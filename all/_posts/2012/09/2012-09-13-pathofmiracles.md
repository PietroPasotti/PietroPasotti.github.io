This is true silence<br/>true violence<br/>and this is the path of miracles<br/>remember I'm sorry<br/>don't whistle don't worry<br/>climbing the path of miracles<br/>think about me<br/>of what I could be<br/>a stone on the path of miracles<br/>a flute of bamboo<br/>to make song of you<br/>a note on the path of miracles<br/>walking and walking<br/>seeming and melting<br/>snow on the path of miracles<br/>hand in your hand<br/>my lady, my friend<br/>we walk on the path of miracles<br/>look at that star<br/>is this what we are?<br/>two lines on the path of miracles<br/>lonely lovely place<br/>a silent embrace<br/>first step on the path of miracles<br/>I'm part of this dawn<br/>of this being alone<br/>a brick in the path of miracles<br/>your sunrise will shine<br/>like your eyes in mine?<br/>the top of the path of miracles.
