The time of the burst<br/>has come and got burned<br/>got real and truly true<br/>was faster than you;<br/>the hour of the call<br/>has come, has gone, did fall<br/>he rained on us like a fairy dust<br/>like a dragon blood or a silly dream<br/>like a nightmare you can't explain<br/>like a suffering, or like a pain;<br/>the time of the star<br/>has shot over me<br/>has imposed on us<br/>his long red hands<br/>his only friends<br/>the time of erase<br/>they say, just a phase;<br/>truths are dying in the streets<br/>dying everywhere, without respect<br/>without protection<br/>people are killing without a reason;<br/>winter has come in any season.<br/>The time of the frost<br/>is ready to spread<br/>from an inner core of death<br/>he thrives like a growing child<br/>like an expanding universe<br/>so poor of light, yet powerful,<br/>and I am drinking this loneliness<br/>like my analcoholic dream,<br/>made to survive I am<br/>made to survive.
