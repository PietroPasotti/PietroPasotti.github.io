Of all the answers I could pay<br/>if you love me, let me rain.<br/><br/>Every day<br/>we take our moments<br/>our little pleasures<br/>little revenges on the face of time;<br/>you who gave us birth<br/>who gave us filth and pain<br/>if you love at all, let rain.<br/><br/>Every day<br/>the answers take longer<br/>to reconcile our hopes<br/>the days are getting shorter<br/>as summer's coming in<br/>in a deep sorrow hours are knocking<br/>many hearts are pulsing<br/>thin waves of "let us go"<br/>thin voices weave<br/>our false perception of dim light<br/>thin voices swear<br/>words I will ignore<br/>in a bottle of clean water,<br/>not in gin lies lore;<br/>and if, after all,<br/>you've gained all you had to gain<br/>and fed up your cruelty hunger<br/>then please, let me rain.<br/><br/>You can tell me wrongs are everywhere<br/>you can tell me sins are thriving even if,<br/>even if, even if;<br/>this is not what I want<br/>this is not what I need<br/>if that is all you have to say,<br/>please, let me bleed.
