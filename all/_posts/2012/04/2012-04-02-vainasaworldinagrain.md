Every day a spell detaches<br/>a part of me falls off in silence<br/>a brain ache of a new dimension<br/>turns me on like a bright projection;<br/>on a cloudy sky I gleam and glee<br/>as all broken promises turn up<br/>and make me desire<br/>a starry night divine.<br/>Outer space is cold, so cold<br/>my musique is sick of me<br/>and blackened by my rain<br/>son of a polluted brain<br/>vain a as a world stuck in a grain of pain.
