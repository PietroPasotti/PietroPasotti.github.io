Bleeding love from every side<br/>from the top of the hills I hear your call<br/>echoing to me, your bloody bride,<br/>and dancing on air, like a waterfall;<br/><br/>signs were given, hands have shaken<br/>still it wasn't enough for them,<br/>the clouds are heavy, there is no heaven<br/>but we've many flowers' stems,<br/><br/>if this is not enough for us,<br/>hopeless and dazed we will go on<br/>mind my aches, my eyes, my lust<br/>is there to tell me what I've done;<br/><br/>oh I can't fix anything at all,<br/>oh, you neither can<br/>then honey, fool,<br/>what're we doing, then?<br/><br/>There is no ship, no boat, no sand<br/>is there anywhere to go?<br/>is there anything to mend?<br/>well honey, must say no.<br/><br/>
