How I felt on you<br/>was like a thin dress<br/>sunk on a tiny surface<br/>trying to impress<br/>myself, my form<br/>onto your tender shiny diamond<br/>trying to be your missing piece<br/>trying to be your frame<br/>if all this is to blame<br/>then there's, right on me,<br/>my shame.<br/><br/>How I felt about you<br/>as simple as it is<br/>all I was - a mannequin.<br/>My bouquet of old field flowers<br/>was rotten long before the marriage<br/>I was sorry, really sorry,<br/>couldn't help to steal from me<br/>my wishes and denials<br/>my great and forced burials.<br/><br/>How the story ends<br/>how the memory dies<br/>far and farther still are here<br/>behind the wall of teeth<br/>I stand above and cry upon<br/>everyday I feel alone;<br/>this is hard, my boy,<br/>my lady, my broken toy,<br/>the end resumes the start,<br/>from settling into place<br/>to falling down apart.<br/><br/>How the story went<br/>how the path got bent<br/>the straight he had been<br/>the swirl it soon became<br/><br/>if is all this to blame<br/>then there's, right on me,<br/>my shame.<br/><br/><br/>How good things were done<br/>was all because of you<br/>how you sew the moments<br/>one another into a flower chain<br/>a flower rain, a flower bow,<br/>a &nbsp;flower river, a flower flow;<br/>you fought the battle I gave up<br/>all alone, in the dark,<br/>in your ocean I'm the shark;<br/>you endure the emptiness<br/>of the sky you see so glittering<br/>of the sky I think is falling<br/>right into our wondering eyes.<br/><br/>How bad things were said<br/>there is me afraid<br/>there is my loveliness<br/>my painful brain regress<br/>and shadows crawl and melt a fool<br/>taking into account my neuro jam;<br/>there is me, in all of my fault<br/>the crisis I bear<br/>has fall slowly on me<br/>right from the nowhere<br/><br/>All I have to say<br/>thank you, sorry,<br/>as I always beg and pray,<br/>as I always do<br/>the best of my worse worst.
