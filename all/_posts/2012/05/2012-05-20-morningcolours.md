The morning comes later<br/>in rainy days,<br/>the clocks all together<br/>go back again,<br/>the fireplace grins with sparkles<br/>promising its heat,<br/><br/>the swears I can't take<br/>the vows I can't break<br/>float on thin surface<br/>these rainy days.<br/><br/>Always late we are<br/>the mist condemning all to gray<br/>these thick colours <br/>seem so lonely yet so peaceful<br/>how can this be?
