A creamy page again<br/>a rose is falling down;<br/>with empty gravity<br/>grieving over me<br/>I fall along as well<br/>fall back within my shell.<br/><br/>Golden silence golden hair<br/>tonight is true, and foul is fair<br/>here you are, I'm far away<br/>I'm bird of prey<br/>but yet to come<br/>forgiven again gone;<br/>leave me now<br/>alone.<br/><br/>An empty simmetry has risen<br/>during the night the blossoms have all opened<br/>thousands flowers I can't see<br/>are now gleaming in front of me,<br/>what is this for?<br/>is it all or there is more?<br/>I loudly pray for silence<br/>and hate you for you love me<br/>there's nothing here to die for<br/>nor there's anyting to live<br/>we are to look at this beautiful sunset<br/>we can shed no emotions on these bloody grounds,<br/>we are to see what's there and fancy our thoughts<br/>nothing is being said, nothing is being felt<br/>our hearts are left, uselessly lie on the seashore, melt;<br/>go far away, do not come back<br/>the sun has gone<br/>the sea is black.
