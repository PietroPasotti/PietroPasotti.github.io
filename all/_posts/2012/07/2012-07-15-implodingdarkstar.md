Filling time again<br/>flowing in slow motion,<br/>falling backwards in the well<br/>my dark matter in implosion<br/>is thin like a hair<br/>a brown cotton thread<br/>sew in the head<br/>of a puppet with brown eyes<br/><br/>filling time again<br/>like oil on a stormy pain<br/>slowing clocks and rain<br/>entangling hair of those who fail<br/>the sea is cruel<br/>and must prevail.<br/><br/>Dark rays from a far system<br/>where a far star is gleaming calm<br/>where a distant sun is dying alone<br/>swallowing the space<br/>in a black and bright embrace,<br/>the sun is us<br/>the sun is me<br/>the sun is all and smiling glee,<br/><br/>he's got black hair<br/>he's most unfair<br/>he's not the star we're seeing from here,<br/>not anymore<br/>he's burned and tore<br/>for pain's own sake<br/>until the day he come to choke;<br/><br/>a sun with flu is a strange image<br/>but even worse, is a sun in rage.<br/><br/>Filling time again<br/>I draw back my threads and lines<br/>retire my many handed arms<br/>praying silently for a silent rain<br/>for she could relief my plague<br/>for she could heal my grief and pain.<br/><br/>I need more steam,<br/>my love, my gleam,<br/>I need more poison<br/>to keep myself dead<br/>I need more matter<br/>to become what I dream to be<br/>to become a black hole<br/>and decay silently<br/>along with the rain,<br/>consuming a dark star<br/>and its abyss of pain.
