O my heart<br/>fails within a humming leaf<br/>light sped in thick autumn air;<br/>and thinks in deep despair<br/>in deep oceans and deep thoughts<br/>on deep eyebrows standing on the cliffs<br/>standing on the cliffs<br/>O my heart.<br/><br/>O shy space<br/>is difficult to fly on you<br/>and to cut you through<br/>making seamless leaps so as not to seem<br/>so alone,<br/>an untamed shadow has fell on me<br/>she said - redeem - and I redeemed<br/>but nothing changed<br/>I saw the man<br/>and all of my dream<br/>tight in my embrace<br/>vanished in a gleam<br/>O shy space.<br/><br/>O you man,<br/>man who stands alone<br/>man who believes in feathers,&nbsp;but not in flight<br/>man who believes in war, but not in fight<br/>man who thinks some flowers would never bloom<br/>man who waits for winter tight into his cocoon<br/>and the cocoon will break apart<br/>steady as you fall<br/>your wings will open, they'll be your art<br/>man who believes in greatness, but lives within the small<br/>O you man.<br/><br/>O my dear<br/>my muse, my butterfly, my man,<br/>listen to the words of, hardly said, a pelican<br/>I'll swallow you through if you leap on me<br/>I'll fall along with you if you try my wings<br/>I'm one and one with you since you have not tried<br/>I'm ready to the fall if you so far have lied.
