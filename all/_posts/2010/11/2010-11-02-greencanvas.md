Falls softly on my skin and down into my hands,<br/>I feel such blindness slowly kills me<br/>I can almost sense it moving my arms<br/>and the abyss is even nearer<br/><br/><br/>the door is even closer<br/>it's going to drive me mad<br/><br/><br/>ants crawling in my head.<br/><br/><br/>My walls give no protection<br/>and shields are given to fight the truth<br/>nobody's caring about the water<br/>I'm setting sail towards our failure.<br/><br/><br/>Green canvas are our new way to proof<br/>poor horizons are left to make believe<br/>what would I give to see you now. <br/>
