When all the love has gone away<br/>and passion comes to wash my face,<br/><br/><br/>when all the faith I tried to kiss<br/>is swift a silence, emptiness,<br/><br/><br/>when all the life turns off to darkness<br/>then I will find my peace to nowhere,<br/><br/><br/>truth and lie keep blinding over<br/>turning bending trying to cover,<br/><br/><br/>when these blonde hair'll be discovered<br/>and the lady will be murdered,<br/><br/><br/>then you'll begin to get your truth<br/>your false illusions slice of air<br/><br/><br/>I'm like your peace I am your war<br/>I'm like like a bomb ready to explode,<br/><br/><br/>I'm not in peace I'm not too weak<br/>I'm not too strong I'm not too wrong<br/><br/><br/>and those are columns made to break<br/>and made to crunch down on my face,<br/><br/><br/>I'm not a symptom of the truth<br/>I'm not my age I'm not my youth,<br/><br/><br/>and is your face I see when eyes are<br/>full of tears and opened wide<br/><br/><br/><br/>I'm like your peace I am your war<br/>I'm like like a bomb ready to explode,<br/><br/><br/><br/>and are your tears not mine are flowing<br/>I'm guilty, guilty, since I've stolen,<br/><br/><br/>I'm like a thief a tiny daemon<br/>sneak in your bed and take your freedom<br/><br/><br/>I'm like a thief a cloud a false wall<br/>I close around you, break to pieces.<br/>
