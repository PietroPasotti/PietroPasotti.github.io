Space is shanty<br/>silence, peaceful, plenty.<br/>No sound means beauty<br/>when nice things do come<br/>all black is soothing:<br/>black holes in the sun.<br/><br/>Hair freedom and your mouth,<br/>my lips, are all about.<br/>They all day look and do,<br/>share everything they need<br/>far happiness on you,<br/>you flower, blossom, seed.
