Waves are proud to sway<br/>on the edge of you,<br/>I love you.<br/><br/>Everything I do believe into<br/>is you<br/>and we devour our words<br/>and pace against our time<br/>we're not afraid to die<br/>and we need to believe into<br/>I love you.<br/><br/>See my mystery<br/>touch its sharpness<br/>its beauty<br/>and our questions are the key<br/>we will be far deep as sea<br/>and always be blue<br/>I love you<br/>I love you.
