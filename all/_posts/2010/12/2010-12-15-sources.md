My sources are empty<br/>the well twirls like a leaf on the water<br/>and on the water I write <br/>so as not to be read<br/>but the leaf nothing she can<br/>but be of her palest red;<br/><br/><br/>almost afraid<br/>almost in me<br/>I find my sources<br/>like a way I always needed<br/>like a place was always searched<br/>not of the greenest green.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
