On the road it's now so white with snow<br/>I teach you about the things I know<br/>I teach you of all I mean<br/>of all I see <br/>of all I need.<br/><br/><br/>All the places I visited with you<br/>now are there being black &amp; blue<br/><br/><br/>on the road I felt was ours there is<br/>a smiling old man selling sins<br/>we walk along<br/>like friend and friend<br/>we touch the river<br/>become now.<br/><br/><br/>And now you're there and there I am with you  <br/>like a path we crossed by chance<br/>we crossed like crosses rivers through<br/>our wide bright eye<br/>with a blink glance.<br/><br/><br/>And so the roads I left and walked away<br/>I learned to fly I learned to dream<br/><br/><br/>and the roads they felt so tired and they<br/>they now are white I'm there I'm back<br/>but not alone we'll never be<br/>because somehow<br/>a road is me.<br/>
