Foreign times impose in me<br/>a deaf violence ablaze in me<br/>a battle you need me to fight alone<br/>and I feel so afraid.<br/><br/>Please this cruelty is not who you were<br/>I left home chasing my star<br/>as I came back you weren't there<br/>I'll tell you my stories, I got far;<br/><br/>please dead stars are flickering<br/>they wouldn't love you insane<br/>your hope is you, you are your king<br/>my tears are words, I sing in vain;<br/><br/>preciously declared, my martyrdom is me<br/>tiny little and devoured<br/>dying stars spread out their glee<br/>here I stand, ignored.
