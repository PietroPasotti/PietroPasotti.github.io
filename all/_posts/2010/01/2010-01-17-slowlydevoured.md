Slowly devoured<br/>these are stories<br/>these are songs worth living,<br/><br/>aren't you your words?<br/>Aren't you the shade?<br/>Aren't you an idea?<br/><br/>Timid ices are pelting<br/>my surface and my solitude,<br/>shy memories are melting<br/>like sugar in your shade;<br/><br/>I love your shape<br/>and I want it to happen,<br/>will we become something<br/>or will this be mistaken.<br/>
