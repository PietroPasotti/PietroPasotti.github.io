Where are your eyes<br/>always an eclipse<br/>pain echoes in my head<br/>alone afraid and paralysed,<br/><br/>my smiles flew off with you<br/>all I am became a tear<br/>entangled in your happiness<br/>I must come clean<br/>I must confess,<br/><br/>give me freedom to be free<br/>my choices when I'm to choose<br/>petals inside my dour<br/>she rose<br/><br/>and she has not forgiven<br/>my hands lie empty, risen.
