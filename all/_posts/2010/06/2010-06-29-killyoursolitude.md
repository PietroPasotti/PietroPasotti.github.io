I'm afraid I see myself<br/>I see my hands about to murder<br/>I woke and caught myself red-handed<br/>my hands tight around a shadow's neck<br/>I just wanted to kill<br/>to kill your solitude.<br/><br/>I'm afraid as we're alone<br/>we're alone and we can't touch<br/>we'd be one by now but space<br/>splits our shades like shiny ice<br/>let me kill, let me kill<br/>let me kill your solitude.<br/><br/>It's driving us crazy<br/>to look for bliss in starving eyes<br/>in starving people and lonely nights,<br/>we can't fade out now, no we can't,<br/>I'm here, I'm here<br/>a step forward<br/>together now, one you, one me,<br/>one step towards<br/>one, one two three.
