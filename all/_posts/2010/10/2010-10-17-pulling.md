I've been looking for some space<br/>but my heart was full of you<br/>but my heart was full of ache<br/>golden nails were getting through;<br/><br/><br/>I've been claiming for my reasons<br/>I've been hiding me my truth<br/>I've forgotten many seasons<br/>and the feelings you will sooth;<br/><br/><br/>seems so far away and yet is<br/>and yet is in our hands<br/>your words are grieving selfish<br/>keep dying in the sands;<br/><br/><br/>I've been trying to shrink my body<br/>in a room that's always full<br/>where will I find space to ready<br/>for a change I'm trying to pull.<br/><br/><br/>
