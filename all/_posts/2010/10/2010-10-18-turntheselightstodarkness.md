As unknown pages turn to days<br/>as memories go back to when<br/>we were a golden sickled flame<br/>we were a city burned and far<br/>as children lie and vanish here<br/>where lines do meet and winters come<br/>estinguish dreams and deafen suns<br/><br/><br/>and I was there you to overcome!<br/><br/><br/>Reset and burn and turn it all<br/>I'm no one but strong and tired<br/>and I, forgiven tamed and weak<br/>I'm not a hill I'm snowy peak<br/>I'm not a valley nor a sea<br/><br/><br/>I'm nemesis of all your real!<br/><br/><br/>Put down these bones those bricks<br/>are near I'm there to follow you,<br/>and I'd be free but I am not<br/>and 'round your neck my necklace shines<br/>and 'round your cheeks my kisses fly<br/>forgive my wounds as I fall down<br/>my head is bowing more than ever<br/>I'll hang my thoughts to where I am<br/><br/><br/>I'll turn these lights to darkness.<br/>
