Slowly fading different shades<br/>I come to know another truth<br/>the beauty which surrounds us<br/>shan't be believed to harm;<br/>hey rude boy<br/>wonder is in easy<br/>complexity won't help<br/>convolution won't heal you<br/>that is why you're dizzy;<br/><br/>I'll run my rails to you<br/>I'll fly that little nearer<br/>believe a little stronger<br/>please hold me<br/>you, my sea.
