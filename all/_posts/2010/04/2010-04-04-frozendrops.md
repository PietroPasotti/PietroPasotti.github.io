Just as simple as it is<br/>when we glow is nice to freeze<br/>still holding drops<br/>our days are here<br/>no longer with my darkness<br/>my happiness is there,<br/>rest beside you night and day<br/>I want to sleep in you;<br/>can I lay my head down<br/>down on your hands<br/>and keep yours in mine<br/>like our tiny hearts,<br/>so anxious to become<br/>stars.
