A night is spreading<br/>don't you hear it?<br/><br/>You spent a life and now<br/>you pay for it;<br/>that's where out paths<br/>ar going to meet.<br/><br/>And is this lust,<br/>I'm lost I'm lost,<br/><br/>an island in your sea<br/>I am willing to be;<br/><br/>and tiny leaves<br/>don't you see?<br/>Floating by,<br/>here in the sea;<br/><br/>and all this glow<br/>isn't the night?<br/>Well if that's a nightmare<br/>it's never been so bright.
