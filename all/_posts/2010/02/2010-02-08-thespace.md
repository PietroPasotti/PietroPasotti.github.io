Hidden surfaces of you<br/>I walk backwards below<br/>the rivers' skin I want to touch<br/>I swim with you that life<br/>that's you that's me<br/>that's what I want to be;<br/><br/>I think<br/>all of this could be remembered<br/>I hope<br/>all of this could last forever;<br/><br/>when we want is today<br/>we desire this hidden peace<br/>speeding towards nowhere<br/>touch the stars embrace the space,<br/><br/>I'm your star I'm yours<br/>I'll kiss you all my light<br/>reds and grays I'll fire my rays<br/>and love you within the embrace<br/>of this soundless joyful space.
