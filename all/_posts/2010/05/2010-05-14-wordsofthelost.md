It was my world to see you again<br/>frame a place inside my heart<br/>that is where I should have lived<br/>but my life had been too short.<br/><br/>We could begin again all over<br/>we should seem so proud to love her,<br/>though that memory had no future<br/>and I had to turn towards her.<br/><br/>Revelations somersault and glee<br/>shines and glows again there<br/>drains off my eyes I see<br/>all over as I see her.<br/><br/>Embody traits of seldom<br/>I hope that's not a symptom,<br/>my aches are curses fading<br/>I desperate am taming.
