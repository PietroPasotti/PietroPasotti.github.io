Fade outside me<br/>you want to tear me down;<br/>this aches<br/>are bad, are bad, I know.<br/>I'm to follow my own way<br/>to my edge not to your plain<br/>I can't bear loneliness,<br/>I may bear pain.<br/><br/>I look for a memory<br/>a future worth remembering<br/>we live in a beautiful place<br/>you're spoiling it with ache.<br/>Divide the rivers with a word<br/>sides are distant more and more<br/>how could I feel near,<br/>find grace to find my shore?<br/><br/>You keep wasting my hope<br/>my will of beauty and faith in love<br/>are you my hidden monster<br/>the only thing I wouldn't save?<br/>Don't make me make my choices<br/>I'm just living my chances<br/>they happen all at once<br/>like a mouth with many voices<br/><br/>all saying don't depart:<br/>just keep following your heart.
