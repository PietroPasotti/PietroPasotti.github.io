I've seen the train run to the rainbow<br/>the steamy iron walk like a daemon<br/>his huge black wings emitting shadow<br/>his pulsing life wounds no sensation,<br/><br/>when trains go on without a station<br/>when nights go on and become day,<br/>they think like steel can't feel emotion<br/>but look will not when ends railway.<br/><br/>I know all deserts turn to sea,<br/>this fire is thirst: not blood, but water<br/>if it's too far I'll walk and see,<br/>after an oasis I'll find another;<br/><br/>I've seen the darkness touch the desert<br/>like a black river on the day,<br/>will take the unseen and then revert<br/>all colours gone when ends railway.<br/><br/>The sands will flow like rivers grow<br/>when clouds are seconds in a grain<br/>until the end the moon will glow<br/>when dunes melt down under the rain,<br/><br/>you'll stand by me hands on my heart<br/>your eyes on me like stars are they<br/>rails are like days, run and depart<br/>be not afraid, ends the railway.<br/><br/>Like a devil or a king<br/>he rushes sweating dust and steam<br/>like a grey ghost under his wing<br/>his shadow flows along his stream,<br/><br/>he has no fear like haven't I<br/>but we can feel and sing and say<br/>and try to tell these deserts why<br/>there's peace inside this long railway.<br/><br/>No one has driven for such long nights<br/>his mother moon is dressed in white<br/>will come kiss him turn off the lights<br/>kiss him again kiss him goodnight;<br/><br/>I hear what's now leap inside you<br/>I know because it is the day<br/>we face this harmony being true<br/>whatever comes:<br/><br/>we're our railway.<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">To Martina, and our railway... </span>
