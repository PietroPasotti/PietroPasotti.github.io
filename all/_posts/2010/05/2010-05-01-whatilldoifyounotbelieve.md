If I were a dragon<br/>you know I'd eat your heart<br/>could you blame me now<br/>and kill before I start?<br/><br/>My evolution will take further<br/>what I couldn't do alone<br/>as myself this reddish eyes<br/>are as nice as every stone<br/><br/>teeth and wing won't help me live<br/>but you'll see my eyes, and then<br/><br/>believe.
