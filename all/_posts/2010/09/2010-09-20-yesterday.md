There are times we refuse to sink on our own<br/>when we're still the ocean roaring louder<br/>there are ways we refuse to follow<br/>waters are there ready to swallow<br/>like a mist those days you seem ready to jump<br/>when the roads are filled with that heavy damp;<br/><br/><br/>here I am here I found you, <br/>when our paths crossed we were just raining alone<br/>now pride of our circles<br/>we're ready to meet<br/>on silver mountain surfaces.<br/><br/><br/>
