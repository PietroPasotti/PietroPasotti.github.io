The dew still coats my finger-tips<br/>the sun is low and all is red<br/>its light has kissed no redder lips<br/>nor smiled a smile as crazy-mad<br/><br/>a lighthouse flower with its fire<br/>pierced the darkness and the sand<br/>and never had a man so dire<br/>been so lost in so little land<br/><br/>but the light reached into you<br/>and pulled his strings with ability<br/>I pour my wings into the blue<br/>and let the sky pour into me<br/><br/>we glow again, like little moons<br/>like them we orbit along new sines,<br/>we let the warmth caress our rooms<br/>and round the corners of our lines<br/><br/>we let the moment seize our hearts<br/>salute the spring which glows and booms<br/>this is where and when it starts<br/>while every single flower blooms.<br/><br/><i>To Itzel...</i>
