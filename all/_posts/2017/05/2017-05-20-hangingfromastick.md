How can I trust myself<br/>if nobody trusts me<br/>how tall can an oak tree grow<br/>how lovely could it be<br/><br/>you don't know what to do<br/>the way we run around each other<br/>is confusing like the smoke<br/>coming up from a forest fire.<br/><br/>But this is your heart not mine<br/>hanging from a stick<br/>waiting to be hit<br/>hoping to be hurt, or be no longer sick.
