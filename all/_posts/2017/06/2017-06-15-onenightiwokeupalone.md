One night I woke up alone<br/>I thought I wasn't, then I was<br/>spent the whole day by the phone<br/>as if waiting for the cause<br/><br/>but a reason didn't show<br/>as I waited the whole day<br/>which went by obscenely slow<br/>and untainted by sunray.<br/><br/>One night I woke up lost<br/>my bed was gone, my living room<br/>had left behind a memory ghost<br/>and then went hiding on a moon<br/><br/>the freezing space was mine<br/>to cuddle, stare at, hold<br/>my tears went burning into brine<br/>and I had nothing to behold.<br/><br/>One night I didn't wake at all<br/>and it was weird but gentle, warm<br/>like some ruins on a hill<br/>just like waking up at home<br/><br/>all the sounds were gone, the smells<br/>they went hiding through the cracks<br/>they slipped ringing through the bells<br/>and got lost between the rocks.
