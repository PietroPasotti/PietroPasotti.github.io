I cannot talk this invisible anguish<br/>shake it off, dance it away,<br/>bury it in a drawing<br/>freeze it in a painting<br/>scare it with a story<br/>frame it in a picture<br/>act it off my future<br/><br/>there it is, tall as a mountain<br/>swaying and failing<br/>angry tree<br/>towering over the foliage<br/>of all my other feelings<br/><br/>there it is, angry as a ghost<br/>tired and naked<br/>crippled by despair<br/>give me back my air!<br/>I scream, but I cannot talk<br/>this invisible anguish.
