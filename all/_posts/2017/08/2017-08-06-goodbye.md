It hurts me deeply to see you go<br/>we barely met but I don't know<br/>it was something to look up to<br/>a subtle magic around you<br/><br/>a spider thread for me to grasp<br/>with the strength I still have left<br/>holding together my skin of dust<br/>and all the things I have possessed.<br/><br/>Rows of ghosts of clowns and men<br/>keep repeating that I can<br/>keep insisting that I walk on<br/>this land in which I don't belong.<br/><br/>But you seem to tread as light as air<br/>no footprints, no grief, or any despair<br/>off you go, on your yellow bus<br/>breaking the edge between you and us<br/><br/>it is so unfair, I'll never see you again<br/>and all we shared was a bit of rain<br/>no warmth, no nothing, but still<br/>you kept me alive against my former will.<br/><br/><i>To The Two Dutch Ladies...</i>
