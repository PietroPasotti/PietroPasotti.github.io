Did we ever talk?<br/>The things we told each other<br/>couldn't fly, but could they walk?<br/>A story has been told<br/>but for us no part to play<br/>was given or was sold<br/>although we had to pay;<br/><br/>now, suppose you had a final say<br/>over what shall live or die<br/>would you speak or would you pray<br/>that what you want isn't a lie?
