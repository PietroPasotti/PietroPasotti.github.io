Lonely man on a sandy moon<br/>totally devoid of purpose<br/>dinner's served but he's not hungry<br/>the time is ripe but he is bored<br/>if only he was not ashamed<br/>of what the space has turned him to<br/>crater upon crater<br/>just waiting for the next<br/>where is the sea of tranquility<br/>that he was promised long ago?<br/><br/>No water, no thirst,<br/>adjust your dreams to reality<br/>as reality won't fit to you<br/>but the only sea there is solitude<br/>and its waves don't easily forgive.<br/><br/>Lonely man on a sandy moon,<br/>what is all this space to you?<br/>Separating things from things<br/>and you from everything<br/>an endless blade no one can wield<br/>look down the well in which we're spilled<br/>and see absolutely no reflection.<br/><br/>There's only sand at the end of the trail<br/>you sought for more, to no avail<br/>you sought for things in the wrong places<br/>and now you belong where nothing else does<br/>and lonely you are on this sandy moon.
