Before the diamond stops spinning<br/>enough time has passed<br/>enough lengths we waited<br/>and battles we lost<br/><br/>now what do we have to lose<br/>aren't we at the end of the world<br/>with nobody else to talk to,<br/>wrapped in things we cannot use<br/><br/>we notice we're blind<br/>the light is out we are alone<br/>only shiny teeth grinning<br/>we're left alone to find<br/><br/>the diamond ain't no longer spinning.
