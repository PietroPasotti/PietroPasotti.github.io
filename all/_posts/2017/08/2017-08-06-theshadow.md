I came here ready to die<br/>or so I thought<br/>but I wasn't ready to live<br/>or to love what time had brought.<br/><br/>Unnaturally cold<br/>I shiver with every thought<br/>and I am projected along my sight<br/>crushed against what I'm staring at<br/>I leave a dark print behind<br/>and on I move, trying to rewind<br/>but I drown in smaller and smaller seas<br/><br/>every time<br/>and I wash ashore on smaller islands<br/>more and more barren<br/>every time.<br/><br/>I used to know how to lock in to my dreams<br/>and wonder off to lighter places<br/>escape to wider spaces<br/>but I lost my way some time ago<br/>now I wonder many times the same road<br/>before I realise I've been stepping on my shadow<br/>and failed at my attempt of hiding from this cold.
