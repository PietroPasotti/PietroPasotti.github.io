I've been feeling more at home<br/>in much less homy places<br/>I've shown my real emotions<br/>to much less friendly faces,<br/><br/>there is something in clean air<br/>and the tidiness of things,<br/>that stinks mistrust along the way<br/>just like so many human beings,<br/><br/>perhaps I fail to enjoy<br/>the make-up of reality:<br/>if things are ugly<br/>they should be.
