What did the mountain say to me,<br/>that I cannot know for sure<br/>she spoke in such a low tone<br/>I'd never heard before;<br/><br/>but sure she spoke, and she said things<br/>of birds and kings, of gods and wings<br/>which I can't repeat because<br/>they were unnaturally wise<br/><br/>in short, I can't say shit.<br/>So why the hell did I start writing this poem.<br/>Buh.
