Goodbye, little man<br/>I loved you for one night<br/>as I carved you for their eyes<br/>and their hearts alone.<br/><br/>Goodbye, little man<br/>you would have been proud<br/>for being born under a cloud<br/>you were as pretty as one can.<br/><br/>Goodbye, little man<br/>you were dark ink in my history<br/>but I hope you shall become<br/>bright emerald in her memory.<br/><br/>Goodbye, little man<br/>may your long nose lead her far<br/>and in the darkest night<br/>always look at the morning star.<br/><br/>Goodbye, little man.<br/><i><br/></i><i>To Nikke, to the little man...</i><br/><br/>
