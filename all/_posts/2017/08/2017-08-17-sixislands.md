Not so long ago<br/>we drifted away<br/>away and apart<br/>if say so I may<br/><br/>we visited six islands<br/>and from each one we took<br/>a sample of its silence<br/>and wrote it in our book<br/><br/>we dug a hole and put it there<br/>and we hoped that it would grow<br/>not an apple tree, nor pear:<br/>something that no man can sow<br/><br/>sticks and stones now mark the top<br/>of the knowledge blooming up<br/>fruits so ripe they may just pop<br/>and it doesn't seem to stop<br/><br/>but in the ground<br/>where secrets stride<br/>a screaming wound<br/>rots gaping wide<br/><br/>it smiles and stinks<br/>and as it winks<br/>a nausea grows<br/>that no wind blows,<br/><br/>no man can take<br/>thus I awake.
