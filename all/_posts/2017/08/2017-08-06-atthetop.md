At the top<br/>I've always stood<br/>or I have fallen<br/><br/>the more you see<br/>the harder it hits you<br/>when the horison catches up<br/>with our negligence.<br/><br/>The final step was walked<br/>by tiny men like us<br/>who moments before jumping<br/>decided to look back.<br/><br/>Butterflies and little flowers<br/>found their way up to my side<br/>and flap their wings next to me<br/>as I try to hide<br/>not to interfere<br/>not to pick a side.<br/><br/>
