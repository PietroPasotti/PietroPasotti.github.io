A hungry daemon within my chest<br/>had himself once been possessed<br/>and so, struck by hollow pity<br/>gifted me with his own city<br/><br/>he didn't think it very through,<br/>as such a gift, to me and you<br/>can be given, devoid of sin<br/>only to daemons worse than him<br/><br/>a truthful mirror, then, revealed<br/>what my soul had held concealed:<br/>I could have banished with a nod<br/>the daemon to whom I was a god.
