I hope the page has turned<br/>the truth is told<br/>the ghosts have burned<br/><br/>but anyway<br/>the times have witnessed<br/>many a cities engulfed in flames<br/><br/>and nobody ever screams<br/>out of our little circles of empathy<br/>where we fail to ignore<br/><br/>what is really going on.<br/>Now we must be strong<br/>for our days are numbered<br/><br/>but they seem to keep growing<br/>and the grass seems greener<br/>and the winds keep blowing<br/><br/>and the stones are marked<br/>with angry lashes of wet paint<br/>by sleepwalking willow trees.<br/><br/>Hide behind my roots, my dear<br/>may a deep slumber hold you tight<br/>like I would hold you if I could.
