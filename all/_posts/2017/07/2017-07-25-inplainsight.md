In line of sight<br/>you hide from me<br/>there's no denying that<br/>there's only parts of me<br/>that would like you to be here<br/>for all the rest of me;<br/>in a curve of thought<br/>you take refuge<br/>my love, you live<br/>in subterfuge<br/>hidden in plain sight<br/>you hope to hide from me<br/>but I see your eyes, and<br/>you cannot hide those<br/>from me.
