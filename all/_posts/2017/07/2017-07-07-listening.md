What you see,<br/>nobody else does<br/>what I do<br/>no one else can see<br/><br/>is this my curse of secrecy?<br/>while dooming myself to silence<br/>and lonely dark corners<br/>I skip over the face of the rivers<br/><br/>hoping somebody will call my name;<br/><br/>hovering atop my thoughts<br/>as if I didn't quite belong<br/>into my head a little painful vine<br/>grows stronger by the day.<br/><br/>If I had a god I'd pray<br/>or maybe I should anyway<br/>someone is always listening,<br/>and if you can answer, so can they.
