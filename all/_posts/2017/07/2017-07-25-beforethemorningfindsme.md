Before the morning finds me<br/>I'll say a word or two<br/>may she see right through the<br/>sky she rises through<br/><br/>another wavelength hid away<br/>beyond my sight and reach<br/>beyond the scope my words can lay<br/>atop a dark glazing of speech.<br/><br/>Before the morning catches me<br/>finger-deep in jars of jam<br/>may she see right through the<br/>heap of lies that make me a man.
