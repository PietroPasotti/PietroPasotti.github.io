I breathe out and I deflate<br/>one more time and it's all gone<br/>a moment too soon<br/>a moment too late<br/><br/>I'm free to be myself now<br/>let the waves wash me ashore<br/>toss me around, weightless<br/>and clean me to the core<br/><br/>as a pound of ashes, now<br/>my journey is resumed<br/>I am that oak, up on that hill<br/>that no fire can burn,<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; and is by every warmth consumed.
