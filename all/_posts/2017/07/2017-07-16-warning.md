Attention please, the truth is told<br/>to only those who give her gold<br/>and while our shape in mud we carve<br/>we all get what we deserve.<br/><br/>Attention please, the false is told<br/>to only those whose heart is cold<br/>and while we trick ourselves with pain<br/>we hold a world we can't sustain.<br/><br/>Attention please, not true, nor false<br/>is told to everybody else<br/>and while our words from there we reap<br/>we lose the dreams we can't outsleep.
