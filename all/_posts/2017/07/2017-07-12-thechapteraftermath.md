As the page unfolds<br/>am I still sane<br/>my hand, she holds<br/>a paper crane<br/><br/>she looks at me<br/>now motionless<br/>no eye can see<br/>no word express<br/><br/>that frozen depth<br/>that emptiness.<br/><br/>Long before I had my wings<br/>I strolled the earth like humans do<br/>I ate and slept with broken beings<br/>and in return was broken too<br/><br/>long before I had my sense<br/>and knew the meaning of my words<br/>I lived my life through someone else<br/>and sucked my breath out of their worlds<br/><br/>long before my eyes could blink<br/>I saw no light, like I don't now<br/>floating alone within a nameless sink<br/>treading pains I shall avow<br/><br/>long before I had a face<br/>lonely spirits cried my name<br/>while I longed for an embrace<br/>I could uphold without no shame.<br/><br/>As the moon turns gray<br/>am I still sane,<br/>what do you say<br/>my paper crane?<br/><br/>I say the book is running dry<br/>of tears and blood, it's dying cold<br/>as it runs out of things to cry<br/>so go the pages crying gold,<br/><br/>and that's when I reply,<br/>that the book is getting old.<br/><br/>Lately I've been stuck in a dream<br/>on which I clung, along the wave of need<br/>in times when I could feel the stream<br/>and all the things that oceans bleed<br/><br/>lately I have been hiding my ghosts<br/>yet along they sail, like an invisible crew<br/>fighting the tides and manning their posts<br/>shining on me like droplets of dew<br/><br/>lately I have sunk in despair<br/>in the lonely anger scourging my chest<br/>in the scars my dreams left as they went in thin air<br/>condemning my soul to a sleep without rest<br/><br/>lately I've been trying to keep my mind in check<br/>as we drifted towards the edge of the map<br/>riding the waves at the wheel of my wreck<br/>every nerve tense as if waiting to snap.<br/><br/>As the winds calm down<br/>and the fury rests,<br/>as I no longer drown,<br/>chirping in their nests<br/><br/>a hundred paper cranes<br/>stretch their paper necks<br/>as if looking for remains<br/>of the last of many wrecks<br/><br/>and the ghosts of all my pains<br/>haunting sunken decks.<br/><br/>One day, but not too soon<br/>I'll find a way to ride the stream<br/>and find my way back to the moon<br/>to seize the chance of one last dream<br/><br/>one day, but not too late<br/>the pages torn will lay a path<br/>fragile enough not to cripple my weight<br/>blessing the ashes of a grand aftermath<br/><br/>one day, I hope at last<br/>I'll find my place, and its mere view<br/>will make it worth of all things lost<br/>and lay to rest my haunted crew.
