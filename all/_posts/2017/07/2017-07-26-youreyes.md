The more I look into those eyes<br/>the deeper they look back at me<br/>subtleties accumulate<br/>until they break the dams<br/>and when the lave's broken loose<br/>it's late, too late, to choose<br/>to live another life<br/>or flip just one more page<br/>to find ourselves the comfort of<br/>just a slightly bigger cage.<br/><br/>Another time, another day<br/>your hinds in mine<br/>my eyes in yours<br/>it's a funny game we play<br/>and we refuse to lose<br/>yet it's way too late to choose<br/>to live another life<br/>or take just one more chance<br/>parallel universes<br/>bloom away right where they branch.
