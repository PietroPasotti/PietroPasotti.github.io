Not on my feet I came this far<br/>of all the things, I bear the scar<br/>across my eyes, a longing rift<br/>hallucinating, as I drift<br/><br/>across this spaces, of things untrue<br/>alternative stories for me and you.<br/><br/>Not on my feet today I stand<br/>not on my clouds today I'll land<br/>of all the lies whose scar I bear<br/>I cannot help but fear the stare<br/><br/>the nameless faces throw at me<br/>the nights that I can't get no sleep.
