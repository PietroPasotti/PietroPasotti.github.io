You gave me hope<br/>you threw a rope<br/>to a drowning child<br/>but it was not enough<br/><br/>now the storm washes us apart<br/>and the waves that seem to laugh<br/>disguise the soul of something wild<br/><br/>you gave me love<br/>the love I felt<br/>you did your best<br/>but it was not enough<br/><br/>a beautiful day woke us up<br/>on different shores of different seas<br/>the light that shines upon our faces<br/>was blazed away by different stars<br/><br/>still despite this scary distance<br/>our heartbeats resonate the day<br/>and though in depths of separate hearts<br/>still they blink in the same way.<br/><br/>But this was not enough.
