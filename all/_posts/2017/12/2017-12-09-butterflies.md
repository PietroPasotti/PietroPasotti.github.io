On my wrist, there lies<br/>a little flock of butterflies<br/>there's something odd<br/>about their eyes<br/><br/>they look around,<br/>as if in search<br/>yet they don't probe<br/>as if too lazy<br/><br/>are they even butterflies?<br/>Maybe I am crazy<br/><br/>They pierce the air<br/>with tiny cuts<br/>are they even flying?<br/>Maybe I be nuts<br/><br/>Maybe they are cats<br/>with super-long eyelashes<br/>with eyes of burning love<br/>and paws of frozen ashes<br/><br/>Maybe on my wrist<br/>there was a drop of honey<br/>maybe it's just one thing -<br/>one tiny fluffy bunny<br/><br/>I lured onto my arm<br/>with one of many tricks<br/>or one of the tattoos<br/>dancing 'round my hips.<br/><br/>No, I now realise<br/>this alien fantasy<br/>belongs to you<br/>but flew to me<br/><br/>this wicked, twisted,<br/>colour-swollen flare<br/>is you, laying me bare.<br/><i><br/></i><i>To Maya...</i>
