I don't know much about you<br/>but a gentle wind blows on<br/>has been calling me for long<br/>I just didn't know where from<br/><br/>and the way you move your lips<br/>and the way you bow your hips<br/>the fine cut of your eyes<br/>the gentle tone of your replies<br/><br/>your smile is still on me<br/>floating by<br/>like a curious butterfly<br/>until tomorrow, there shall be.<br/><i><br/></i><i>To Maya...</i>
