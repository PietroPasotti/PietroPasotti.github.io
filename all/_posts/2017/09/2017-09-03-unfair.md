Waiting for a change to occur<br/>without a warning sign<br/>withering some more<br/>wilting fore the tide<br/><br/>only stable things can move me,<br/>and as I hide behind your eyelids<br/>wild creatures overgrown<br/>with stones and jungle I can see<br/><br/>I've been training my thoughts<br/>streamlining my perceptions<br/>and failing to withdraw<br/>from my former self<br/><br/>I thought I had a view<br/>from here, to there<br/>but then, all that I knew<br/>was how to be unfair.
