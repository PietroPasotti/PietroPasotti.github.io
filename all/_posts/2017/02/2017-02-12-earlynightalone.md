Early night alone<br/>if it ever was here<br/>then where has it gone<br/><br/>shaking and turning<br/>trying and failing<br/>the code has been broken<br/>the lines are derailing<br/><br/>soothed confused<br/>numbed to a demented smile<br/>by feelings unknown<br/>and thoughts in exile<br/><br/>they talk and they tell<br/>their stories to me<br/>they bubble and swell<br/>like foam from the sea<br/><br/>trust my ability to overcome any ease<br/>forget any word that you hear or say<br/>take my puppet hands and move me as you please<br/>leave or remain, save me from it or stay<br/><br/>nothing upon nothing<br/>piles up atop my roof<br/>like a hat collecting snow<br/>like a child caught in a flow<br/><br/>bigger than him, bigger then us<br/>bigger than anything we've ever seen<br/>because if all is lost<br/>then nothing is, and all has been<br/><br/>imagine a place surrounded in roses<br/>imagine a house reflected in water<br/>where all hope goes lost and soothed is pain<br/>when no leaf or silence falls ever in vain<br/><br/>imagine a castle with a tower so tall<br/>from the sun or the moon you could not see it all<br/>imagine a dungeon so deep with desire<br/>that if it were burning you would quench it with fire<br/><br/>this is my soul and as I look in there<br/>hollow upon hollow goes flailing everywhere<br/>sorrow upon sorrow agonizes silently<br/>but is just another corpse piling up inside of me<br/><br/>three stories we'd been told<br/>for the warmer days and the cold<br/>but no story ever explained<br/>how to clean a soul when stained<br/><br/>how to take my skin off like a dirty hood<br/>lather and rinse, repeat until boom<br/>standing where I stood<br/>is another me, but less me, more cartoon<br/><br/>with pointy ears and a painted smile<br/>and frozen flat like a flower on a tile<br/>because a new boy is a new toy<br/>just a wooden tool without a chance of joy.<br/><br/>
