Reaping my soul,<br/>harvesting my memories<br/>collecting my teeth<br/>locked in a silver box<br/><br/>stalk my shadow on the doorstep<br/>pull my hair until they snap<br/>hide my eyes in a dark corner<br/>disseminate my secrets in every country on the map<br/><br/>my heart is cloudy,<br/>my head is hazy<br/>it took a while, but after all<br/>I may be going crazy;<br/><br/>books were written on this moment<br/>people quarreled up and down<br/>etched their footprints in the corridors<br/>chiming at every little surprise<br/><br/>like broken bells<br/>like red-crazed bulls<br/>like tiny fairy angels<br/>fallen through nine hells<br/><br/>my hands are cold,<br/>my legs feel lazy<br/>it's not much of a change, but now<br/>I feel I may be going crazy.
