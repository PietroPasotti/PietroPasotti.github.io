With heavy hands and broken lips<br/>I crumble on my hips<br/>I choke on a mouthful of air<br/>if it weren't transparent I'd call it despair<br/><br/>if it weren't so silent I'd know it was pain<br/>if it weren't so dry I might think it was rain<br/>the symptoms are there but I'm a circle of health:<br/>my invisible enemy is a master of stealth<br/><br/>opening my mouth like a final breath<br/>but when I close my eyes I cannot see my death<br/>only cloudy thoughts and a frightened little child<br/>who looking at his pain, a crooked smile had smiled.<br/><br/>
