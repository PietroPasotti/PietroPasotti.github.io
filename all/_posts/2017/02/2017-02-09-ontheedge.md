Amidst these rising tides<br/>the waves, the wind,<br/>the setting moon<br/>about to be drowned by another blast of darkness<br/>about to be turned<br/>like a fallen leaf.<br/><br/>On the edge of all that<br/>I stand thinking what is next<br/>what if I fly<br/>what if I could hover<br/>feel no more pain<br/>instead of joy because the pain is over.
