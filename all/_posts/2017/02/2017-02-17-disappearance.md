Nowhere to be seen<br/>disappearing in a pouf of dust<br/>hiding behind a sheet of air,<br/>as my time is running fast<br/>keeping up appearances because the smile seems fair<br/>walking in your shoes but I'm just walking past<br/>I'm already nearly gone and I haven't seen you yet<br/>and while I know no shame, I have a thick shell of regret<br/>that I carry around my shoulders like a golden shawl<br/>for anyone to see, judging their way through<br/>hoping they may pry<br/>all through me and right back to you;<br/><br/>I just crawled back down to hiding<br/>barely realising I was left behind<br/>I have no clue where I am going<br/>or what I might or might not find<br/>I am a mystery of myself<br/>and make mysteries of all<br/>I'll make a mystery of you<br/>I know so badly that I will<br/><br/>tremble back to safety<br/>where the lines are drawn by me<br/>where the shapes are running clear<br/>as they are supposed to be<br/>where the sounds don't echo, hitting objects around the room<br/>and the voices stay put, and nobody is alone<br/>and my heart is free to cry and go boom:<br/>I'm not there already, here I am already gone!<br/><br/><br/>
