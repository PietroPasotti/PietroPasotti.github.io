Lashing out<br/>reaching up<br/>finally free<br/>spilling my cup<br/><br/>a wave of silence rises and falls<br/>by the rhythm of the moon<br/>and of your all in alls<br/><br/>a raging tide of dangerous pride<br/>builds up against the walls<br/>and in the basements, in the shade<br/>through the windows down the halls<br/><br/>drowning in their sleep<br/>those who didn't care<br/>the wolf alike the sheep<br/>all lay fallen then and there;<br/><br/>what a dangerous miracle<br/>what a terrible surprise<br/>watch the stars now<br/>fall and rise,<br/>watch the sunset melt the ocean<br/>vapourise my face<br/>in a final gust of rage<br/><br/>the speed of which rewinds the clocks<br/>and lifts the waves into the space<br/>and crushes mountains down to rocks<br/>just to wash away my face<br/>in a final gust of rage.
