We feather down at the same speed<br/>you and I<br/>when in a void<br/>and tied together<br/>and glued by our backs<br/>a hundred retreats <br/>a hundred attacks<br/>who told gravity to flow the other way<br/>who told all the birds<br/>one by one<br/>they had nothing left to say,<br/>we look around<br/>no sky no ground<br/>we look ahead<br/>but hear instead<br/>a different sound.
