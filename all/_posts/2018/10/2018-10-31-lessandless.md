As the road winds between my fingers<br/>my lifelong search for meaning<br/>structures willing to be handled<br/>puzzles wishing to be solved<br/>I realise I'd been hiding<br/>my face between those thoughts<br/>and my eyes behind that face<br/>I've not been completely honest<br/>with you, my dear, with me<br/>up a chimney there it goes<br/>ashes in the October breeze<br/>may someone breathe what's left<br/>to carry on broken shoulders<br/>to sweat through aging feathers<br/>to take on the next silence<br/>hope it will live on<br/>keep on burning, hard ablaze<br/>yet every time I touch my face<br/>there's less to recognise.
