As the silence falls<br/>the seed still rests<br/>buried in the ground<br/>growing but not thriving<br/>they're asking me what drives me<br/>I'm driven by inertia<br/>I'm swamping into it<br/>driving it away<br/>driving it crazy<br/>when it's crazy enough<br/>where will I be?<br/>Open my eyes in a rotting forest<br/>surrounded by ghosts who don't want to talk<br/>driven by a nail halfway in my forehead<br/>a tickle on my neck I don't know how to scratch<br/>a pain inside my eyes I chase off with a shrug<br/>screaming all the love<br/>that can't be hidden in a hug.
