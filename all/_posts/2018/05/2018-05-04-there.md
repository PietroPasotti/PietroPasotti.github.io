And there among those arms<br/>for a moment i thought<br/>I had it almost figured out<br/>the hows and whys<br/>of the alien glow<br/>beneath whose light<br/>my lines can show.<br/><br/>And there I thought<br/>after so much was found<br/>I could bury the spade<br/>lie down and rest, on the ground.<br/>No grass was left<br/>the barren ground<br/>shone treacherous smiles<br/>from desolations of sand.<br/>Too much I'd dug up<br/>to even bury myself<br/>and once I saw what I'd done<br/>I couldn't see nothing else.
