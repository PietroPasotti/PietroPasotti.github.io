Who else is shaking<br/>before the front door<br/>who else is knocking<br/>like never before?<br/><br/>There's a whole line<br/>of men like me, like us<br/>a piece of bread a glass of wine<br/>and let's make no more fuss;<br/><br/>aren't thoughts enough complex<br/>we fold them in our skins<br/>we hide them in our sex<br/>we turn them into whims<br/><br/>until clever silences ensue<br/>the dreams we can't pursue.
