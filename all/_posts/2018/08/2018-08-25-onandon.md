My neck is bent<br/>a twig between hands<br/>unable to feel<br/>unable to grasp<br/><br/>you have to let it grow<br/>uncertain as it feels<br/>unfair as it may be<br/>when I am there for you<br/><br/>and my head now in the clouds<br/>or stuck in someone's thoughts<br/>haven't we waited long enough<br/>how is it still here<br/><br/>a tower on a hill<br/>and on and on I will.<br/><br/><br/>
