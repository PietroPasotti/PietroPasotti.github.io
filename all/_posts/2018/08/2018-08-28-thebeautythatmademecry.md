She was so beautiful<br/>she made me cry<br/>and to this day<br/>I don't know why.<br/><br/>I'll dress up for you<br/>as much as my closet lets me<br/>and take you for a walk through<br/>a park, or let's do tea.<br/><br/>I'll refrain from burping<br/>at least for today<br/>whatever keeps me hoping<br/>for a little, I know, but hey.<br/><br/>I'll have my eyes all over you<br/>and then draw your lines<br/>and search for that shade of blue<br/>for the rest of our long lives.<br/><br/><em>To that beautiful dutch lady...</em>
