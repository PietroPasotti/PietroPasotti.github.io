You may spot me dressed in black<br/>against a shadow or a cloud<br/>I blend in crowds<br/>because I'm tall<br/>you may not spot me at all,<br/>my heart is gently swayed<br/>it takes just a simple smile<br/>and up! my heart is made.<br/><br/>I must confess a little truth<br/>I have no heart<br/>I've had no youth<br/>I've made it all up<br/>one night as I was bored<br/>and I keep finding things<br/>yet to be explored.
