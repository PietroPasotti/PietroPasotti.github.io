Aren't we all searching<br/>and what is lost along the way,<br/>the land the sun is scorching<br/>isn't that the price we pay<br/><br/>forgive to me the thought<br/>that no matter how I do<br/>you're twice the man I'm not<br/>I'm half the girl in you;<br/><br/>I do alright, by the way,<br/>thanks a lot for asking calmly<br/>what my rage won't let me say<br/><br/>I've been trying to look ahead<br/>my neck won't hold it long enough<br/>and look aside and up, instead,<br/><br/>my body is searching places<br/>to bury itself into<br/>my face is seeking faces<br/>and one of them is you;<br/><br/>I've been searching restlessly<br/>but then again, haven't we all<br/>a jigsaw that won't fit in me<br/><br/>a piece of us that may be small<br/>a little keystone of my heart<br/>holding up the castle wall.
