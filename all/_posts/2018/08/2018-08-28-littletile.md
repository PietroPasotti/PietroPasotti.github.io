Clench my fists in anger<br/>sand thrown in my eyes<br/>I'm an angel I am<br/>a devil in disguise<br/><br/>I owe to my foundations<br/>if I am still alive<br/>but then again I wonder<br/>what else is there to love<br/><br/>if not your eyes in awe<br/>if not your brilliant smile<br/>forgive me my little cracks<br/>let me be your little tile<br/><br/>put me on your doorstep<br/>the day is over the porch is quiet<br/>the guests are treading soft<br/>into the dying light.
