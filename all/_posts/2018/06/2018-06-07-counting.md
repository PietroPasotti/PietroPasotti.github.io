Nothing comes up straight<br/>like it was meant to be<br/>nothing grows as high or low<br/>as it was meant to grow<br/><br/>nothing will smile back<br/>without a valid reason<br/>no flower ever blooms<br/>not even in its season<br/><br/>nothing ever does<br/>what it was meant to do<br/>I mean nothing, no-one, zilch,<br/>and here I'm also counting you.
