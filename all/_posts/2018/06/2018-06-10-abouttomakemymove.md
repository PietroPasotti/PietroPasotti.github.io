I'm waiting for the right moment,<br/>to stand up and take control<br/>to sprint and make my move<br/>until then, I hide and crawl<br/><br/>I bite my nails and chew my lips<br/>drink my pain in little sips<br/><br/>my name hasn't been called<br/>neither side has claimed me<br/>but at least I'm burning cold.
