Between the palms of my hands<br/>runs a lightning stronger than<br/>any wind I'm ever become<br/>any rush I ever felt<br/>any shame and any guilt<br/><br/>between my fingertips there lies<br/>a web of gold and butterflies<br/>and their powder falls like snow<br/>and its power and its glow<br/>sinking deeper within me<br/><br/>raise a song of dusk and dawn<br/>and all the wings I am become<br/>and all the hands<br/>I raised in awe.<br/><br/>As I try to paint the blurry kingdom<br/>the blurry king just talks to me<br/>like a mystery he goes<br/>on and on and stories grow<br/>the tales of queens and fairies and<br/><br/>a tale of joy at the very end<br/>a tale of hands and arms and wings<br/>of flapping, waving, dancing songs<br/>a tale of us a tale of winds<br/>a tale that rushing takes a sweep<br/><br/>at anything we held too deep,<br/>and as I paint the blurry kingdom<br/>then I close my eyes and see<br/>the blurry king is painting me<br/>like the last of many kings<br/><br/>crowned by many coloured wings<br/>my eyes untainted gazing by<br/>my heart ablaze with my own spell<br/>for I'm become a butterfly.<br/><br/><i>To Maya...</i>
