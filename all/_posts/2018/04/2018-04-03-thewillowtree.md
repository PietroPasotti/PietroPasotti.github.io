One morning I decided<br/>to adopt a willow tree<br/>I was sad - said he<br/>until you came along<br/>and now I'm feeling strong<br/>so strong, in fact, that I, you see<br/>a willow can no longer be<br/>up and up, and forward still<br/>I want to grow<br/>and my hair throw<br/>into the wind for all to admire<br/>first gold, then green, then burning fire<br/>such is the wish in which I burn<br/>- then on he asked if I could turn<br/>him into such a glorious plant<br/>and even though he knew I can't<br/>there he stood for me to enjoy<br/>every tree is big enough,<br/>for a little boy.
