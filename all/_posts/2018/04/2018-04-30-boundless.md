Here to freedom, boundless life<br/>boundless love above all things<br/>here to drugs, and cows with wings<br/>and octanes, cars, and miniskirts<br/>to youth and words of no consequence<br/>to thoughts gone by unnoticed by<br/>anyone likely to take offence<br/>to the here and now, my love, to you<br/>a queen of a hill<br/>but a queen still<br/>if I'm a leash and little more<br/>I hope I'm tied to something<br/>worth living for.
