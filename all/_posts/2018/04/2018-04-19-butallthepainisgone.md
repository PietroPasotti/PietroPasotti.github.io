Oh there's no need to walk<br/>stay where you are<br/>allow me to tear<br/>tear you apart<br/>to make a new whole<br/><br/>After all we're hiding in the details<br/>little devils ourselves, we are<br/>what do we do behind our skins<br/>and someone else's dreams<br/>some saints would call these sins.<br/><br/>But on I wreck, on I pry<br/>keep on staring<br/>until I force myself to cry<br/><br/>things do change, and now<br/>it's strange, different things<br/>can all be done<br/><br/>but all the pain is gone.
