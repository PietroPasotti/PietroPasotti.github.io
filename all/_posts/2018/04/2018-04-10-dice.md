A quiet scratching falls<br/>along the trunk<br/>like a droplet of clear dew;<br/>is the time of waiting due<br/>to be up anytime soon?<br/>I remember when I sunk<br/>so deep and up, in the lagoon<br/>counting breaths.<br/>Like a cartoon,<br/>next page I'm up<br/>wrist-deep in a very different world<br/>is it the moon -<br/>we there at last?<br/>Are we in the past?<br/>Am I still in my cocoon?<br/>That's not a dice for me to cast.
