Give me an angel<br/>to lock inside my ribcage.<br/>I'll jump into the sea<br/>and drown next to the key.<br/><br/>An angel is a letter<br/>the recipient gets to pay<br/>I'll jump in a volcano<br/>and burn it all away.<br/><br/>I hid an angel in my skin<br/>I thought it would be safe<br/>turns out my skin is brittle<br/>and it's hard enough to move<br/>any colour code will do<br/>to read my mood out of my eyes<br/>tonight;<br/>I may seem to have control<br/>over the spirit of my thoughts<br/>turns out my fabric's brittle<br/>and it's hard enough to think<br/>alone.
