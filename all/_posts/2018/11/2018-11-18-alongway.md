I've come a long way<br/>don't you see?<br/>dad, my steps are punched into the snow<br/>I'm sure you would agree<br/><br/>I've come a long way<br/>for my poncho to smell the way it does<br/>I've crawled along some narrow ridges<br/>become a cat stretching its paws<br/><br/>I've built some rivers burned some bridges<br/>set my home right where I stood<br/>called some bluffs and told some lies<br/>I've got accustomed to this mood<br/><br/>such a long way I have come<br/>I was a flower and I was free<br/>so much I needed ground and roots,<br/>have I become a tree?<br/><br/>I've come a long way<br/>for my nose to dig in soft warm spaces<br/>my voice to echo from my burrow-bed<br/>to feel my heart a little spacious<br/><br/>now I'm struggling not to stick a note on this thought<br/>not to give hasty names to these little delights<br/>every inch of the way is an inch I have fought<br/>and now I'm a tree and I'm so sick of fights<br/><br/>I'm one more unknown to all but a few<br/>our little hills getting smaller and bare<br/>it's one bitter leaf we all have to chew<br/>may it bring peace to the oceans we fare<br/><br/>this brings my mind back to the moment at hand<br/>a hand in my thoughts keeps digging its way<br/>into uncharted land<br/>where all thoughts are stray<br/><br/>unwinding my wake<br/>it goes back a long way<br/>a long tail I can't shake<br/>a little word we can't say.<br/>
