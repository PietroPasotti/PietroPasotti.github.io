Students crying<br/>red flags flying,<br/>in the blowing wind<br/>I asked in my mind:<br/><br/>what am I doing,<br/>where am I going,<br/>why am I crying?<br/><br/>The nights in the bed,<br/>thinking world's bad,<br/>looking for something<br/>that must be found,<br/>looking for something<br/>that can't be found.<br/><br/>Who am I?<br/>Why am I?<br/>Ask for no answers ,<br/>but fight for workers.<br/><br/>Crowds of punks,<br/>troops of policemen,<br/>painted trucks,<br/>communist newspapers,<br/>crying control breakers.<br/>Falling I scream:<br/>Is there sense? Is there any sense?<br/><br/>The nights in the bed,<br/>thinking world's bad,<br/>looking for something<br/>that must be found,<br/>looking for something<br/>that can't be found.<br/><br/>There's who ask friends,<br/>there's who asks god, fish and rod!<br/>But crying alone could be,<br/><br/>no one can tell me<br/>what am I to do,<br/>where am I to go.<br/><br/>The nights in the bed,<br/>thinking world's bad,<br/>looking for something<br/>that must be found,<br/>looking for something<br/>that can't be found.<br/><br/>Ask for no answers.
