Is my mother sadness,<br/>as my father weakness,<br/>holdin' on in this world<br/>is like feelin' never born:<br/>feel your heart<br/>broken apart,  take a mirror in your cart.<br/><br/>Looking in the mirror,<br/>you can't stand the horror,<br/>the fear of misunderstanding<br/>of people that you're watching.<br/><br/>Free your brain, free your eyes,<br/>just rip off your prejudice,<br/>or be cursed for all your life.<br/>Open your mind,<br/>now I'm sure that you can find.<br/>Open your eyes,<br/>let your heart melt down like ice.<br/><br/>Looking in the mirror,<br/>you can't stand the horror,<br/>the fear of misunderstanding<br/>of people that you're watching.<br/><br/>Dream, dream that you're alive,<br/>the moment for love will soon arrive;<br/>stabbed by an arrow<br/>you'd be dead by tomorrow,<br/>but this is the cruel pain:<br/>being bound to life like with a chain.
