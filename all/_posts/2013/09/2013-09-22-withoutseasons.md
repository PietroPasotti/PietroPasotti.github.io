Uncountable crows are explaining me the evidence<br/>fly-by one another,<br/>not all worlds are made to suffer<br/>mating systems are selected with much ease and competence<br/><br/>there's no need to quarrel<br/>keep away from me your patience<br/>you appear to have no sentience,<br/>I would rather fuck a squirrel;<br/><br/>your arms grow longer as I try to make my way - out<br/>your nails fresh cut<br/>your tail like a - rat<br/>I'd happily bomb down whoever wrote your lay - out<br/><br/>let me down my grounding is o-right<br/>there's no need to start another fight<br/><br/>we could ask the crows for further reasons<br/>or for lies you'd eager swallow<br/>rather than let go that willow;<br/>but the truths, they're without seasons.
