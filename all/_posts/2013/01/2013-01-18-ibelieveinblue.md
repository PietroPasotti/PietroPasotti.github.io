I see you walking along<br/>the grey streets you belong<br/>you say nothing is true<br/>thus there's nothing in you,<br/><br/>you're not what I thought<br/>but I thought it because<br/>you are me I am you<br/>and there's nothing being true,<br/>there is you there is me<br/>and some thin air between;<br/><br/>I follow you walking<br/>the streets you came to<br/>but there's nothing for me<br/>this is your place for you<br/><br/>I see you walking alone<br/>on the path of thick stone<br/>you don't seem happy at all<br/>this is none of my fault<br/>but as I see you cry<br/>my own heart wants to melt;<br/><br/>your legs keep on moving<br/>as a faint butterfly<br/>though this grey path of rock<br/>is so shallow to die,<br/><br/>your feet keep on tapping<br/>the grass I don't see<br/>since the grey felt alone<br/>you somehow made it be,<br/><br/>your eyes see such things<br/>that my corneas refuse<br/>your mouth utters words<br/>which my brain only amuse,<br/><br/>this is not my pathway<br/>you will have to go on<br/>this is me that is you<br/>we will walk all alone<br/>till the night when the moon<br/>will shine bright in dark blue.
