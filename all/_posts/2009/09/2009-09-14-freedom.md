I need to feel alive<br/>for hopes which will last,<br/>there's nothing there to save,<br/>my heart keeps beating fast;<br/><br/>lower volume they might hear<br/>that's how they rule on us,<br/>that's worth calling it fear<br/>but they lost me as I lose,<br/><br/>I need control on freedom<br/>framing my own pictures,<br/>initiative sinks in seldom<br/>a child book without its figures.
