I hope I can dream about you,<br/>risen nightmares inspiring<br/>what I hope you're willing too,<br/>feel so empty if you're near hiding<br/><br/>I won't be prepared<br/>I'm not ready to ache<br/>behind her silver shade<br/><br/>but hers is not your face<br/>and are you here don't hide<br/>I needn't war but peace;<br/><br/>help us out I'll fight and fly<br/>so high my wings can't get<br/>a price too high to pay<br/>not ready to regret.
