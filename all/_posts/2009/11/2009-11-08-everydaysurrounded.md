Everyday is like<br/>like you already mean everything to me;<br/>but it can't be true<br/>I must be myself<br/>without you without you,<br/><br/>I can't be like this<br/>I can't be so confused<br/>I can't be so mad<br/>I'm afraid I'm that bad<br/>I'm afraid I'm mislead;<br/><br/>everyday<br/>my sun hits me,<br/>new rays just keep on spoiling<br/>my confusion deep resolving<br/>into new illusions melting;<br/><br/>everyday as I wake<br/>I find myself surrounded<br/>undesired emotions break<br/>the beauty in which I'm wounded.
