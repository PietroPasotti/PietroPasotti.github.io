Every step will take me further,<br/>to the hopes I lost forever,<br/>signing papers ink or blood,<br/>yet my eyes cry tears like mud;<br/><br/>one of the saddest ever done,<br/>sadness' mother and son,<br/>damned to give me birth<br/>and then deny my death;<br/><br/>will they try to stop me?<br/>Do they believe I'm free?<br/><br/>Do they believe that choice<br/>is still an echo of my voice?<br/><br/>I smile backwards just why<br/>it tears me up to cry.
