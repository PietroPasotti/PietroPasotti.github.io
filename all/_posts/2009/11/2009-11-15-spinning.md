Swift as leaves<br/>I drift your toes<br/>poems for my skin<br/>and breeze<br/>alike my darkness;<br/><br/>almost disembodied<br/>nothing worth of care<br/>wait for it to hurt<br/>but there is no nightmare;<br/><br/>chaining afternoons and nights<br/>for I deserve to feel alive<br/>and it's my chance to live for you,<br/>I won't miss my cliff and dive;<br/><br/>spanning all along the sea<br/>why does the sky keep spinning?
