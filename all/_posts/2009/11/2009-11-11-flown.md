This solitude enhanced<br/>sound waves look flown away<br/>as I dive,<br/>marble pavement<br/>dirty air entangles<br/>my lungs already tired<br/><br/>if I were in love I'd smile<br/>but I face a nameless joy<br/>fathoming on my enigm<br/><br/>try to solve my hopes,<br/>my glass is not a mirror<br/>where go to die your slopes<br/>you diving in your paper.<br/><br/>Was it your shadow<br/>who really flew away?
