Tight I grip the mast,<br/>standing wind I'm blind,<br/>looking to its past,<br/>the ocean far behind.<br/><br/>I imagine being here with death,<br/>standing on the fence of unsaid words,<br/>this wind taking me to breathe,<br/>my lungs still full of thorns;<br/><br/>and I breathe forbidden blood,<br/>still look the sky and cry again,<br/>your eyes are a punch of mud,<br/><br/>and won't be washed by my rain,<br/>heavy you'll fall into you're sad,<br/>and all of this, just brings more pain.
