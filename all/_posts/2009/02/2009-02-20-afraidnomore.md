Any more I stand,<br/>naked swimming in your eyes,<br/>what do I pretend,<br/>there's no more land,<br/>too many broken miles,<br/>and I am weak<br/>so weak,<br/>the end will break,<br/>from plain to peak,<br/><br/>the moor so dark,<br/>will turn to park,<br/>the hills now bare,<br/>will be aware,<br/><br/>and seeds will higher grow,<br/>afraid no more to show;<br/>afraid no more to stand in light,<br/>afraid no more to the midnight.
