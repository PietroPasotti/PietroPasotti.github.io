Bare to myself,<br/>any more I drown,<br/>my dreams are sinking,<br/>am I ready for seeing,<br/>again again this time throw away,<br/>everything I thought I may?<br/><br/>And if I'm not bare,<br/>I don't want to survive,<br/>and if you make me sad,<br/>I really won't now thrive,<br/>and again will drive me mad,<br/>and open eyes, just to see me alive.<br/><br/>Even if, even if,<br/>I could be lying,<br/>even if, even if,<br/>I don't like betraying,<br/>I myself defy,<br/>I cannot rely,<br/>hold on I must,<br/>for I don't trust.<br/><br/>And please don't even say,<br/>I know I thought I may!
