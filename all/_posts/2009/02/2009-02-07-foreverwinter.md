Why the trees are white,<br/>me frozen into cloud,<br/>here the wind to bite,<br/>and I cried, so aloud;<br/><br/>it's been so long a winter,<br/>it's been so like forever;<br/><br/>your diamond dress of light,<br/>everything else still shone,<br/>but blank your eyes were white,<br/>and was too late, to see you gone,<br/><br/>I'm so alone and colder winter,<br/>I feared this last forever;<br/><br/>you know we lost this run,<br/>you didn't get it's not a fight,<br/>against my time you're not the one,<br/>and still again, you pale and white;<br/><br/>but it was so cold this winter,<br/>and now I know that's lost forever!<br/><br/>I needed you so much,<br/>but I see I wasn't right,<br/>you still may deserve my broach,<br/>but this too will turn, now pale and white;<br/><br/>I had made it to bury this winter,<br/>it wasn't enough, to work forever;<br/><br/>you opened wings flew out of reach,<br/>above that tree nor left or right,<br/>that's to your hear I make this speech,<br/>but are you hiding, into that white;<br/><br/>all turned useless to ice or winter,<br/>but can I, be spring forever?<br/><br/>It was so wrong, I did despite,<br/>it was to us, we burnt it all,<br/>but before this white,<br/>should have been fall!<br/><br/>And the gold, empowered in my ring,<br/>may only, turn it all to spring!<br/><br/>Forever winter,<br/>forever fears,<br/>forever winter,<br/>forever tears.<br/><br/>Forever<br/>winter.
