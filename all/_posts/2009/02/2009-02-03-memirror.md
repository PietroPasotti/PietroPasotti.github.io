Am I a mirror,<br/>stare breath holding<br/>stand in front of horror<br/>as I watch me being<br/>another cloud of silver,<br/>breathing meter over meter.<br/><br/>Am I to give<br/>go, run and never brake,<br/>am I to live,<br/>with the nothing I take.<br/><br/>Don't ask me then to do<br/>the mask of one who wants some more,<br/>then this will be your clue<br/>to get what's my seashore.
