You didn't think she is<br/>like songs of the banshees,<br/>she looks like daffodil<br/>but she's something evil,<br/><br/>you thought you saw<br/>into her something better,<br/>but in the same row,<br/>were written beauty and shatter;<br/><br/>and that's betray,<br/>yourself in grey;<br/><br/>and she's lonely,<br/>beautiful as she,<br/><br/>and that's something I could aim for,<br/>next time I'll head for sore.
