Undress your eyes,<br/>and we will make tonight,<br/>more than love, or fire or ice,<br/>we don't need light,<br/><br/>we cut the black this way,<br/>for all the else no place,<br/>don't waste don't say,<br/>just look me into the face,<br/><br/>oneself himself we'll be,<br/>we be us and nothing else,<br/>and even further we will see,<br/>where there's no more room to sense,<br/><br/>my failure and your tears,<br/>your pressure and my fears.<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">To Keleden...</span>
