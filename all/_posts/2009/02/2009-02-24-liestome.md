I seem your being<br/>quick grew up to seeing,<br/><br/>you're older and fat<br/>so as to never forget,<br/><br/>never look me back,<br/>never know I lack,<br/><br/>and still<br/>you fill<br/>my heart with empty choices,<br/>my ears with every voices,<br/><br/>and will<br/>you still,<br/>love me as if you really do,<br/>say me I love you, like if it is true.
