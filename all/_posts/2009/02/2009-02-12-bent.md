Bent to the ground<br/>by the truth I have found,<br/>and this autumn bleeding will<br/>give me power, until the fall;<br/><br/>bent to the flower I'm to grow,<br/>bent to me I am to know,<br/>what I seem to leave behind,<br/>here it is, again to find,<br/><br/>my mistakes overdo my shames,<br/>there words useless this rhymes,<br/><br/>whose dream am I dreaming of,<br/>am I ready to throw me off?<br/><br/>Then I'm proud I dream again,<br/>dreams I know that's not in vain.
