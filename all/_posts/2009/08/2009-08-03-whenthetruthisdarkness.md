Is there a home<br/>of bricks or words,<br/>is there a failure<br/>on the woods,<br/><br/>this shiver breeze<br/>is just a lie,<br/>or you stop freeze<br/>since you will try,<br/><br/>I know what I should do<br/>I know what's really me,<br/>I know but I don't know<br/>what's freedom am I free<br/><br/>this blossom is<br/>ready for me,<br/>I touch the gold<br/>inside her hair,<br/><br/>a tower to catch<br/>falling stars today,<br/>blind as a sun<br/>will I find a reason to,<br/><br/>I know what I should do<br/>I know what's really me,<br/>I know but I don't know<br/>what's freedom am I free;<br/><br/>as I hear that voice<br/>I recognise the darkness,<br/>who are you that's me<br/>caged into your heart,<br/><br/>knock me back<br/>to old opinions,<br/>even your truth<br/>still tells me lies,<br/><br/>and I can't survive<br/><br/>I know what I should do<br/> I know what's really me,<br/> I know but I don't know<br/> what's freedom am I free;<br/><br/>and I can't survive,<br/>I know what I should do<br/>and I can't survive,<br/>like if I do want to.
