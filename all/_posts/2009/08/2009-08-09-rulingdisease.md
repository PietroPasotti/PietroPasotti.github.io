So long so short<br/>clocks run backwards in your eyes,<br/>or are they mirrors I can't lock<br/>aim your money, shoot your price,<br/><br/>played with me<br/>like if I was a broken doll,<br/>slipped through your defences<br/>your shield is weak, will break and fall,<br/><br/>help me get<br/>out of whatever this is,<br/>symptoms tear me up everyday<br/>that's my will or that's disease;<br/><br/>run here smash me<br/>break all cripple what's still moving,<br/>pity entrapped into your eyes<br/>still seems to be, bad ruling.
