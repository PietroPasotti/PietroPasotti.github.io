Better than me<br/>my slim fingers never will learn<br/>to answer my brain with guitar chords,<br/>will I ever play my songs?<br/><br/>There's no way to go nowhere,<br/>there's no sign to follow nothing,<br/>maybe we will become ourselves<br/>find something to get us by,<br/><br/>control our power<br/>to become what we're born for,<br/>but I can't believe so I silence<br/>and the guitar still stands there.
