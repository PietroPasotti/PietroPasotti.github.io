If we are why can't it be,<br/>perhaps there is a reason<br/>an answer to this sparkles,<br/>but there's nothing to see,<br/><br/>I faced many times your anger,<br/>but it's useless to hit the rain<br/>and as I stuck inside your rage,<br/>how could it be better?<br/><br/>restless look at the slow-motion,<br/>it's resounding like if endless<br/>tears could tear my face to ache,<br/>tear me up to my conclusion;<br/><br/>my page has endless days of pain,<br/>like if reasons had no age<br/>still as rainy as inside me,<br/>this whole life will be my bane;<br/><br/>and if we are, why can't it be?<br/>There might be no lives to engage,<br/>but for your lips, or homes or ships,<br/>there will always be a sea.
