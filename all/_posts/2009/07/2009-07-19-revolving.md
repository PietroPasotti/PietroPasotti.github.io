Light nowhere<br/>but I wish to suffocate,<br/>this noise in me<br/>this noise in me,<br/><br/>I can't hear you<br/>what would you say?<br/>What am I missing<br/>of this whole revolving,<br/><br/>what am I made of?<br/>Hopes will goodbye,<br/>of the window of the train<br/>there's no left but a shard<br/><br/>but she said this is pain<br/>we didn't hope was that hard.
