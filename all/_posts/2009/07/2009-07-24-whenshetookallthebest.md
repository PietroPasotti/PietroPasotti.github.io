And as she took all the rest<br/>I had left only my chest,<br/>filled with emptiness inside<br/>by my hand, nothing beside,<br/><br/>and as she took all the best<br/>there was nothing for the rest,<br/>standing still by the same door<br/>identify her name the sore,<br/><br/>and as she took all the best<br/>we became mist,<br/>we became mist...
