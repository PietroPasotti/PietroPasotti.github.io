I want you to snow,<br/>snow on me,<br/>snow until you see<br/>your hands are white and cold,<br/>snow until you feel<br/>you've given out yourself;<br/><br/>everyone who's someone<br/>would be proud of you,<br/>and snow you feel alone,<br/>and snow on me like you;<br/><br/>I want you to snow,<br/>freeze my azure skin<br/>don't look at me now,<br/><br/>when the sun your light will dim.
