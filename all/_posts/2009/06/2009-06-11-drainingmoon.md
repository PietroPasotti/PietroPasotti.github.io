And fades away<br/>what should have been the day,<br/>and will come soon<br/>what has to be the moon,<br/><br/>and I lied and I made<br/>a lot mistakes, now fade!<br/><br/>But still can't face the<br/>please stay here with me,<br/>regardless of where leads,<br/>follow as she pleads,<br/><br/>regardless of her pains<br/>the moon still drains.
