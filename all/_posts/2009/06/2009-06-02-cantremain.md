Still the darkness<br/>swallows<br/>the remains of the day,<br/>in which you sleepless walk<br/>your one is an odd way,<br/>your steps leave traces<br/>I can't write in them<br/>still find some empty pages<br/>to fill with cry and pain<br/>and faster on will fall the paces<br/>of plain views you can't remain.
