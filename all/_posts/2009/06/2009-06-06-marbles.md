You can feel me<br/><br/>but you are so alone,<br/>this is not like that,<br/>so just give up don't shine,<br/>the sky below seems wet,<br/>and don't say it's all fine,<br/><br/>I know you ache within,<br/>can see that in your eyes,<br/>life binds you with thin<br/>marbles of dark ice;<br/><br/>and I breathe like them<br/>in many unknown ways,<br/>I look at her and then,<br/>I life for what she says;<br/><br/>rush to skies don't idle,<br/>forever running marble.
