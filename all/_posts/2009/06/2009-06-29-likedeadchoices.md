Like dead<br/>and I'll follow<br/>the bad<br/>I will swallow,<br/><br/>mindless aches pursuing us<br/>but really we don't mind,<br/>forgotten on that bus<br/>the love you will not find,<br/><br/>as turns on you that smile<br/>you know it's the last one,<br/>you know in the meanwhile<br/>what's surely to be done,<br/><br/>regardless of the bliss<br/>you never give that kiss.
