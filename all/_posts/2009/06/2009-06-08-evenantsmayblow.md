You come as a wind,<br/>you blow upon me,<br/>you look at me and sing,<br/>who is who can you see?<br/><br/>Like a moon the glowing clock<br/>reminds us we'll have to fall,<br/>faster paced every shock,<br/>but still that life we call;<br/><br/>are we lost don't understand,<br/>all of this a cycle ant,<br/>every heartbeat comes to end,<br/><br/>and still believe we can't,<br/>but take the night as friend<br/>to live as if we don't.
