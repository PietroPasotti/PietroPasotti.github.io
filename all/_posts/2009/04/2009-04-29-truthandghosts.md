Shrinking dust instead of roses,<br/>don't manage even to fathom,<br/>why reality all this loses,<br/>without return, becoming phantom;<br/><br/>and you owe me your truth,<br/>the awe I see into my body,<br/>is turned to love by youth<br/>in a hope but far more shady,<br/><br/>the frame fragged by the fray,<br/>still I hunt, but I'm the pray.
