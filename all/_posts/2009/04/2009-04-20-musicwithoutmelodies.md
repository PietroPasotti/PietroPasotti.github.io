I wish I had the chance to make you know<br/>I'm so sorry,<br/>and don't you think we made it through,<br/>our sky we carry,<br/><br/>and if the air might be an excuse,<br/>it's not the cause for I refuse,<br/><br/>I'm here stand still, here I stand,<br/>still all alone reflections mirror,<br/>upon the whole I cannot mend,<br/>upon the death I bear the horror,<br/><br/>and still I can't find a way,<br/>to be the hunter not the pray,<br/><br/>of a life drown into memories,<br/>into a beautiful music, made of no melodies.
