Is taking away from me<br/>the drab of the reflection,<br/>as if the dark could be<br/>the portrait of emotion,<br/><br/>and I cut through this<br/>beauty pure thin water,<br/>so hold on and release<br/>one scream and then another,<br/><br/>and I mirror of the window<br/>the waves upon the shore,<br/>the moon becomes a widow,<br/><br/>I take away some more,<br/>the deep and then the shallow,<br/>then I become aware.
