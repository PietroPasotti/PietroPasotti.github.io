Disbelieve what you used to see,<br/>there is nothing, left for me,<br/>walk bare as a winter tree,<br/>my white dress is worth of glee,<br/><br/>and I cast upon myself<br/>a fairy broken bless,<br/>dividing even the half,<br/>to look for four times bliss,<br/><br/>and I'm kissed by my shark,<br/>and I lie, beloved in dark.
