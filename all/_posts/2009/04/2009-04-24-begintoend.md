Begin to end<br/>an endless end,<br/>made of no days<br/>made of a puzzle<br/>fell in disgrace,<br/>I foresaw the pieces<br/>now fell to the ground,<br/>the silence reaches<br/>what I have found.<br/><br/>And I'd murder my<br/>dark side or light,<br/>without a scream or cry,<br/>fall to earth and begin to fight,<br/>to learn again to walk,<br/>fearless stop to stalk.
