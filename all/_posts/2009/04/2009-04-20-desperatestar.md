The spirit from the stars<br/>for I am to break,<br/>glancing of the scars<br/>the pain I try to speak,<br/><br/>rains through your ice,<br/>as the glitter in my veins,<br/>and desperate she cries<br/>upon the red pang of the pains;<br/><br/>just like the sun she smiles,<br/>and I'm drop you cloud,<br/>a tear in darkness shines<br/>and so cry, tearless aloud;<br/><br/>no moon will wait for you,<br/>alone you must go on,<br/>all of this you have to do,<br/>and still you'll be alone.
