This is the night,<br/>am I the twilight,<br/>showing the day<br/>what I am made of,<br/><br/>coursing in me,<br/>there is a blank page,<br/>which I cannot write<br/>and I'm waiting for you,<br/><br/>thirteen AM,<br/>there's nothing I can,<br/>all of my power<br/>swallowed in the sea,<br/><br/>I'm not free to do<br/>free to go<br/>free to express myself by screaming,<br/><br/>I'm not free to be<br/>free to the<br/>strength and power of the daylight,<br/><br/>feelings of the twilight,<br/>feelings of the twilight...<br/><br/>This is the night,<br/>you breathe into me,<br/>all of the love<br/>I can't live from within,<br/><br/>into myself,<br/>those pieces of you,<br/>that eat out my heart<br/>and I know you can do,<br/><br/>melting my name,<br/>into shapes of shame,<br/>fused in the shadows<br/>I need you to explain,<br/><br/>I'm not free to do<br/>free to go<br/>free to express myself by screaming,<br/><br/>I'm not free to be<br/>free to the<br/>strength and power of the daylight,<br/><br/>feelings of the twilight,<br/>feelings of the twilight...<br/><br/>Raging revenge,<br/>turn into something strange,<br/>all you can do<br/>is to beg me to change,<br/><br/>but I am the night,<br/>I whisper twilight,<br/>I whistle his name<br/>and he's running to me,<br/><br/>but I am the night,<br/>and I will survive,<br/>until the next morning<br/>I'll be under your bed,<br/><br/>and look at my eyes,<br/>glancing on you,<br/>and you will be trembling<br/>as the snow in the wind,<br/><br/>and look at my face,<br/>my dreadful embrace,<br/>and you will suicide<br/>not to let me betray,<br/><br/>I'm not free to do<br/>free to go<br/>free to express myself by screaming,<br/><br/>I'm not free to be<br/>free to the<br/>strength and power of the daylight,<br/><br/>feelings of the twilight,<br/>feelings of the twilight...<br/><br/>Feelings of the twilight...
