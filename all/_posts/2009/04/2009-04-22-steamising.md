And I'd love so much<br/>to fade away become,<br/>the dream I cannot touch,<br/>my sky to be overcome,<br/><br/>and her hair will be<br/>so thin and long and cold,<br/>the skies will not set free,<br/>the whispers as they told,<br/><br/>they breathe the wind,<br/>moonwalking to the dream,<br/>I walk upon no land,<br/><br/>singing a lonely stream,<br/>mad of errors we can't mend,<br/>turned by the stars in steam.
