When you were a child,<br/>they used to say you it's midnight,<br/>believe the lies you all were told,<br/>every choice another fight,<br/><br/>to make you taste the thrilling joy,<br/>for a moment made of lies,<br/>after all you just a boy,<br/>and the memory soon dies;<br/><br/>don't waste your beautiful fury,<br/>you'll do exactly the same,<br/>invent another story,<br/><br/>paint of nothing another frame,<br/>where the magic loses its glory,<br/>imagination becomes a shame.
