Daylight,<br/>stand beside it<br/>and watch it thrive<br/>below your wings,<br/>your heart's a hive<br/>of all good things,<br/>and if this all my friend,<br/>would come to an end?<br/><br/>There's a place for you,<br/>everywhere you go,<br/>there's no place for me<br/>anywhere I can see,<br/>would you climb me up<br/>just to look so further,<br/>just to see far enough,<br/>to see my own slaughter?<br/><br/>And I'll be there,<br/>stabbed in my deep<br/>out of nowhere,<br/>drown in my weep.
