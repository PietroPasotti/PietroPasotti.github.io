Am I, a song,<br/>sang out, nightmares,<br/>am I, so wrong,<br/>but no, one cares,<br/><br/>am I with you,<br/>without a chance,<br/>are you so true,<br/>have not, wrote since,<br/><br/>you cut my heart,<br/>and torn you dared,<br/>you broke me apart,<br/>are not you scared?<br/><br/>I look away, avoiding you,<br/>but in the eyes, I look you through,<br/>and what if sky still means me be,<br/>the only horizon I can't see?<br/><br/>Am I, a song,<br/>a poetry or play,<br/>if I'm so wrong,<br/>why aren't they?<br/><br/>And in the city, always love,<br/>until is late, there is no heave,<br/>and I look for, what I can't have,<br/>forever death, good evil save;<br/><br/>nor one, nor two,<br/>nor I, nor me,<br/>just me, and you,<br/>just let, me be;<br/><br/>facing, a scare,<br/>take off, I can't,<br/>am I, aware,<br/>or know, don't want?<br/><br/>Alone the night the day the pain,<br/>and what's within me fades like rain,<br/>alone still I neglect my way,<br/>and if I can, I'm sure can they.<br/><br/>Am I a song,<br/>facing the night,<br/>it would be wrong,<br/>to avoid this fight,<br/><br/>but I'll give up,<br/>as I'll see you,<br/>this was enough<br/>of hate imbued.
