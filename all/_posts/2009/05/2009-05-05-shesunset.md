Every light has faded away,<br/>there's nothing I need to say,<br/>words fall by themselves down,<br/>towards the blind orb of the sun,<br/><br/>and in the sunset she will glow,<br/>surrounded in a chain<br/>of the rows and words to show,<br/>she is the red and not the pain,<br/><br/>and she will blow away<br/>all the things I used to say.
