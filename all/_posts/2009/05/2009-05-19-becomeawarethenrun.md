I wait to set the sun,<br/>just to take it all and run,<br/>so far so far from there<br/>you will become aware;<br/><br/>and then you'll know at once<br/>what was for that glance,<br/>you thought of it the nights and days,<br/>but love has got too many ways,<br/><br/>and then you'll know I am,<br/>be more than this you can,<br/>and you'll wait to set the sun,<br/>then take it all and run.
