The wind blows twisted rains,<br/>will she come home before dawn?<br/>We have together broke our chains,<br/>to get struck in this ghost town,<br/><br/>and will we forever deserve<br/>this wonderful desert plain<br/>under this sun I starve,<br/>I'd give a rainbow to see the rain,<br/><br/>when you want<br/>what you want,<br/>as if you don't.
