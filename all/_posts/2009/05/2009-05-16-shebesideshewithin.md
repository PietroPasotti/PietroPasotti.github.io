Would you like to feel again,<br/>start to meltdown in the rain,<br/>look your face,<br/>to pour the ache,<br/><br/>by the trees she listens to,<br/>within me but beside you,<br/>could you hear her voice,<br/>have you paid your price?<br/><br/>You'll grow strong please,<br/>just don't make me this;<br/><br/>as a nightmare speaks to night,<br/>a lightning ready to release,<br/>its sadness out of sight,<br/>and she's the cure and the disease.
