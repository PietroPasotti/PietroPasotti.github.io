This can't be the moonlight,<br/>stones shine you left for me,<br/>but the mirror isn't bright,<br/>is black and we can't see;<br/><br/>this can't be the moonlight,<br/>I'm not ready and so you're not,<br/>the eclipse refusing to fight,<br/>and you'll fade, just like that;<br/><br/>and her sparks are still drowning,<br/>beyond the horizon where you can't,<br/>sit on the floor and just starve dying,<br/><br/>but cry but lie or die you don't,<br/>focused on the promise of the promising,<br/>in the vow that take you shan't.
