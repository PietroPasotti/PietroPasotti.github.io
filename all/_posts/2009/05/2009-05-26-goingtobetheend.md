I've been awake so long<br/>just hoping to see you coming,<br/>I waited for so long<br/>all the memories keep confusing,<br/>all the stars begun to fall,<br/>but you never came back;<br/>shut the door<br/>break me down,<br/>smash my face<br/>I'd burn it all again<br/>but it is already gone,<br/>all I did or should have done,<br/>but, any more my friend,<br/>that's going to be the end.
