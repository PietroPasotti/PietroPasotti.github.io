I love the river,<br/>an heritage of dawn,<br/>cool waters flow to frozen<br/>submerged I<br/>grip to my ground,<br/>regret it all<br/>that's all I found;<br/><br/>picked up a flower<br/>so far away,<br/>to come back a day,<br/>come back and stay.<br/><br/>Self imagined by my sad<br/>other emisphere of bed,<br/>I hate the shadows<br/>won't you leave me all alone,<br/>I lie scared until it rises<br/>and then I know<br/>there are few roses.
