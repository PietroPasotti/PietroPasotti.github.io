I can't give wind a kiss,<br/>I look outside for my own bliss,<br/>but there's nobody,<br/>there's nobody,<br/>nobody's there<br/>and here I am bare,<br/>trying the wind<br/>to the way I can't find,<br/>trying the sky<br/>to look for my why,<br/>and I will have to stand alone,<br/>holding up until I'm bone.
