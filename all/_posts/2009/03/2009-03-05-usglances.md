Without a weight,<br/>begin to fade,<br/>go on go straight,<br/>till what you made,<br/><br/>go on behind<br/>this wall of light,<br/>so as to find<br/>some mighty might,<br/><br/>see you into me,<br/>your eyes I am,<br/>we will just be,<br/>we wish we can,<br/><br/>a frozen glance,<br/>a sword a spear,<br/>that will us pierce,<br/>till our heart and fear.
