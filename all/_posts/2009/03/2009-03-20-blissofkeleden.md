For this why and when,<br/>I saw a piece of Keleden,<br/>into you as deep as is,<br/>to this wind and to these trees,<br/><br/>for your how and when,<br/>I'll kiss the whole of Keleden,<br/>into your eyes a trapped bliss<br/>into this circle of glass,<br/><br/>and will slip into your kiss<br/>to make again me bliss.
