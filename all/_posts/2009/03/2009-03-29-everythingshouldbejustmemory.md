Everything of me<br/>should fall into my sea,<br/>everything of my past<br/>should be memory<br/>and I won't get lost<br/>deep into this history.<br/><br/>Everything I felt<br/>should just fade or melt,<br/>under a newer air of snow<br/>letting me to build again<br/>of the truth a tiny rainbow<br/>with the memory in the rain.<br/><br/>Why everything is not just memory?<br/>If love if you if me if every,<br/>I'd choose a circle<br/>to build and close again<br/>with love and a little,<br/>slice of pain.<br/><br/>Everything should be just memory<br/>but I can't get out of history,<br/>I can't forgive<br/>I won't forget<br/>but I can't live<br/>into regret.
