As it all begun<br/>it ends,<br/>today,<br/>an ordinary cold day,<br/>everything was ok for a while,<br/>and then sky breathed his<br/>overwhelming fire.<br/>And here in its crater<br/>I watch the dust and ashes,<br/>in the middle of this shatter,<br/>is there no more sense to collide,<br/>no more hiding, no more pride.
