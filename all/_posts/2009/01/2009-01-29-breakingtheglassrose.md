And what's if<br/>it's the time to break<br/>this beautiful flower?<br/>Down the cliff,<br/>into the waves I make,<br/>into this crystal tower.<br/><br/>Will be I, to throw it down,<br/>down the hill<br/>so as to fill<br/>the quill with blood mown<br/><br/>out of my eyes,<br/>out of my heart,<br/>will it even become ice,<br/>now red is to freeze start;<br/><br/>and we will eat it all,<br/>as a terrible ice cream,<br/>made of the waterfall,<br/>in the blood I'm gonna scream.<br/><br/>And what's if it's really<br/>the time for<br/>breaking the glass rose?<br/>I'v been waiting for me,<br/>and I was sore,<br/>and then he rose.
