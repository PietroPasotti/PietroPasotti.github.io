Afraid afraid<br/>of what's been made,<br/>and what I'd do,<br/>aren't scared you too?<br/><br/>Afraid afraid,<br/>no more to be said,<br/>no more to be shared,<br/>wouldn't I be blamed?<br/><br/>Afraid afraid,<br/>unleash the chained<br/>my will and desire,<br/>my love to admire...<br/><br/>Afraid afraid,<br/>wouldn't we now fade,<br/>if all I'll do would turn to shade,<br/>if all I'll love will be mermaid...<br/><br/>And afraid as anything else<br/>will turn to dust and then to stars,<br/>back to sky within myself,<br/>back to me now cover scars,<br/>and I'd be the happiest one,<br/>and I'll show us what I've done;<br/>what I've built into believing,<br/>what I'm just askin to be living...<br/><br/>Let me shake me off that knife,<br/>let me turn this shade to life...<br/><br/>Let me make out of this moon<br/>something better than this doom...<br/><br/>Let me be into what I love,<br/>let me become the way I live...
