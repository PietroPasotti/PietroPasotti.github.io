Measure my strength,<br/>my eyes are reddening<br/>can't guess your lenght,<br/>your time is out coming,<br/>am I<br/>am I ready for,<br/>the dread of chapter four?<br/><br/>Believing it can be true,<br/>really ready to<br/>waste into you,<br/>everything I'm going to do,<br/>everything will be my wheel,<br/>saying my ear again to feel,<br/>and that's the system,<br/>look into me,<br/>for me turning to listen,<br/>believe me to be.<br/><br/>Am I, am I ready for,<br/>the dread of chapter four?<br/><br/>Won't it be another binding<br/>to someone to me still drowning?<br/>And I plead as it won't be,<br/>I plead for me to set me free!<br/><br/>And now am I, am I ready for,<br/>the dread of chapter four?
