Did you think ever<br/>will come<br/>the time<br/>for me to surrender,<br/>did I even wonder,<br/>will hit with grace<br/>this wonderful embrace,<br/>it's not enough<br/>to make me tough,<br/>did you ever think<br/>my soul will sink,<br/>and every time I blink<br/>it's a defy for me to shrink.<br/><br/>No, we wouldn't imagine this fall,<br/>no, not at all...<br/><br/>But you could say I'm not strong<br/>I say I am weak,<br/>you'll say that's so wrong,<br/>then I'll show you how I break.
