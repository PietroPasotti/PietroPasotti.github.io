Forsaken as this great embrace,<br/>will give me, a chance to create.<br/><br/>Ambition look for something to drink,<br/>I drown in its tears as I try to shrink<br/>this thick layer of thin snow,<br/>and I'm struck by this greatest flow;<br/>it's all about me and you,<br/>nothing wishes to be as is fool,<br/>me alone in myself what have I achieved,<br/>any of this smiles does belong to me believed?<br/><br/>Fly for the last time till your strength can bear,<br/>do not tremble in front of any tear,<br/>once you're down, alone and low,<br/>you may want but will not get, the embrace of the snow.<br/><br/>Make the floods please wave me water,<br/>but in this sadness, in this shatter,<br/>we get to pour some blood or wine,<br/>as turns black what used to shine.<br/><br/>We get to drink this melted white,<br/>a moisture of colours that will give by me,<br/>all of the emotions which shouldn't bite,<br/>and whose shade is that, still to be seen.<br/><br/>Turn myself from tears to dust,<br/>survive to this I will and must,<br/>upon me this won't get cast<br/>another fracture, this is the last;<br/>wave my hands as I cannot,<br/>bring me water or I'll drown for that,<br/>this snow is poison to my lips,<br/>this wall is made in hearts not bricks.<br/><br/>Forsaken as this great embrace,<br/>will give me, a chance to create.
