My world is still the same,<br/>no need to ask your name,<br/>I know I need you being,<br/>let's drive me to believing,<br/><br/>it seems waited has come,<br/>and look at what we've done,<br/>we built upon the rain a bow,<br/>and who will pass will show,<br/><br/>we're here for you,<br/>we're here for you.
