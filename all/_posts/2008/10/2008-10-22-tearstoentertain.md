Love pain, love vain,<br/>you can't be rain,<br/>since you're drops to entertain,<br/><br/>your heart's no longer yours,<br/>you're left in furthest moors,<br/>shame blind upon my eyes,<br/>I shouldn't be that ice.<br/><br/>Her eyes so deep,<br/>mine closed can't keep<br/><br/>any image of a blackheart...<br/>any image of a freedom soul...<br/><br/>but some of that fears,<br/>do deserve great tears.
