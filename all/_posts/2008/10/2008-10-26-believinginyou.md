I believe in you,<br/>since your sky seems blue,<br/>you're not fire maybe,<br/>when we will well see,<br/>thru the glass you caught my eyes,<br/>believe me it's all but ice,<br/>let's not run let's walk slowly,<br/>let's not fail let's let it be.<br/><br/>Let it be from the begin,<br/>let it catch angel falling,<br/>we will see if it is me,<br/>or if someone else will be,<br/><br/>since I failed,<br/>since I got myself once broken,<br/>as I believed,<br/>please please take my heart as token.<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">To Teresa.</span>
