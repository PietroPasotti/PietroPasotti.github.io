We used to miss so much,<br/>be happy until we touch,<br/>then we tasted the way to delete,<br/>the many spikes of me incomplete,<br/><br/>over any arrow<br/>of the deadly sorrow,<br/>we chose the one to borrow,<br/>between the eyes now low,<br/><br/>how would I even speak,<br/>now my life is just a feat,<br/>we had our pain under our feet,<br/><br/>we chose then to be aware,<br/>that who's so much is not to dare,<br/>to give so much, someone so bare.
