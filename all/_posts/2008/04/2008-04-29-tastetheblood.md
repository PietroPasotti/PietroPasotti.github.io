Taste the blood as you've been hit,<br/>and then with strength return back it,<br/>by a sudden violent reddening spit<br/>to who drab so evil you good bit.<br/><br/>Taste the mud you're forced eating,<br/>and then begin brutally back sending<br/>what you can't keep on standing,<br/>and knock off the coward nice assaulting.<br/><br/>And where you are to stand don't sit,<br/>as you have to dour smile don't cry,<br/>while you are to cry alone don't meet,<br/><br/>cause when you are drowning by,<br/>lonely could be, not anyone with,<br/>and then wake up alone, silent ask why.
