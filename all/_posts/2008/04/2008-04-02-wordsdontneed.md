Forgive for everything I should<br/>to you have told,<br/>but I believe not all needs<br/>to be said, just as seeds<br/><br/>to grow up in wild<br/>do not with waterin' do.<br/>Perhaps I should, so<br/>I beg you to be mild<br/><br/>and not to hate me<br/>because I'm weak.<br/>As my heart goes near to break<br/><br/>I'm getting the<br/>meaning of fact I should,<br/>and from now on I promise I would,<br/><br/>choice is yours.
