It's the time to dull truth<br/>take out of the only king<br/>who cannot own his song,<br/>coming clean cannot shout<br/><br/>out his inner dour soul wide,<br/>and pride his sunny shattering.<br/>To him, whose mind is pleading<br/>for being overkilled, I made<br/><br/>the still grieving harass<br/>and precipitated the last compass,<br/>to drab despair left him off, I<br/><br/>even now fathom blind,<br/>how could soulful deep bind<br/>myself overwrought to such fancy.
