Afraid of hugeness<br/>of your being over me<br/>over world and less<br/>your beauty over the<br/><br/>remaining people,<br/>butterfly's less gentle,<br/>to you and to me to<br/><br/>you. I know I do,<br/>I believe your mind,<br/>I've ever knew I'd found<br/><br/>first and least<br/>so white in world's<br/>now lost, burst<br/>in river of salty words.
