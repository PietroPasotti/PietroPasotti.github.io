Drained of my conscience<br/>I'm left alone with me,<br/>and cannot stand the fence<br/>to my life which is the<br/><br/>thought waterfall<br/>thought waterfall<br/>think of all<br/>and what I shall.<br/><br/>If you can just believe<br/>all I can is not enough,<br/>only to that big you beloved,<br/><br/>indeed my reality is tough,<br/>I cannot vanish, how to move?<br/>How to love this life so rough?<br/><br/>I'm afraid as I really<br/>think sometimes I<br/>can only rely<br/>on myself and may<br/><br/>even for an instant black<br/>decide to do what<br/>cannot once done come back,<br/>as I did when heart shot.<br/><br/>Thought waterfall<br/>thought waterfall<br/>think of all<br/>and what I shall.<br/><br/>Conflict of thousand<br/>different blurred voices<br/>of so many screamy voices<br/>and I can only hit the ground.<br/><br/>Once for all I'll say thank you<br/>so loud can be heard for miles<br/>to all of my renewing roots who<br/>taught again me how get smiles.<br/><br/>Dragon picture today<br/>colours and water<br/>in a mixture of power<br/>for a girl I'm to back pay.
