Even if bad things<br/>can only sing<br/>their stories in sad songs,<br/>as a bird without a wing,<br/><br/>crying alone aloud,<br/>while the sun covered a cloud,<br/>when the energy which pushed<br/>me you towards, vanished.<br/><br/>As soon as pang stuns ground,<br/>more and more hard,<br/>it can only shrivel up and dry,<br/><br/>crops cannot flourish and by<br/>the time I played last card,<br/>I got I hadn't radiance found.
