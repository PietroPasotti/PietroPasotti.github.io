If I'm sunny at all there<br/>it's cause you're there<br/>it's cause you're there<br/>and don't joke me and be aware<br/><br/>it's all coming to an end a day<br/>but not today, not today.<br/>And what am I afraid about?<br/><br/>What's that I cannot shout,<br/>what's that making me cry,<br/>that's just killing and passing by,<br/><br/>just that I cannot out me slay?<br/>That's like I am a thunder,<br/>and only I may try to wonder<br/>what's that I cannot render.
