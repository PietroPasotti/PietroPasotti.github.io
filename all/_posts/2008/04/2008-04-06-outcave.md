As I am not to chase<br/>a knave,<br/>now I can just save<br/>this perfect lace,<br/><br/>from worst disgrace:<br/>getting last deceive,<br/>fail forgotten in crave,<br/>stay forever slave.<br/><br/>You know you behave<br/>as never do I will,<br/>but end of world until,<br/><br/>you'll take back what gave,<br/>you'll climb up the hill<br/>and your heart of blood fill.<br/><br/>As I haven't found right place<br/>to see you shine and rill<br/>of love is flowing down to grave,<br/><br/>I have and will never find the will<br/>to get and hold a brace,<br/>to find a way out cave.
