Hand in hand I took you up,<br/>hand in hand until the end,<br/>if you knew you wouldn't have,<br/>but inside I see you brave,<br/>and so complete entire friend<br/>in my heart forever will step.<br/><br/>Believing what others meant<br/>I can say today surely that<br/>I'm grateful to you to exist<br/><br/>and I could have never resist'd<br/>if I would have not you met.<br/>Thank for where you me sent.<br/><br/>Empathy in you, in me, in us,<br/>I first cried for someone's sad bend<br/>and so I knew I had met who<br/>with my love deep thru and thru,<br/>hand in hand until the end,<br/>Hand in hand I could take up.
