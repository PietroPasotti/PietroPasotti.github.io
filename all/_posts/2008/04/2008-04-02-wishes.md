You must know before<br/>the overcoming end,<br/>who most wanted being a friend,<br/>who now in tears just try to ensure<br/><br/>how loved you so strange to me,<br/>who has failed in every to be.<br/><br/>I wish now you as ever did,<br/>everything you would desire,<br/>any love you could acquire,<br/>even if my heart now bleed.<br/><br/>I'm sad in feeling I've not done<br/>enough to see you forever shine.<br/><br/>But to me and every wise<br/>you will seem the frozen flower<br/>whose I could taste a bit of power,<br/>who to world is unowed prize.
