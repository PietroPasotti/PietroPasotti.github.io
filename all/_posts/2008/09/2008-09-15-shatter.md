Play one last time your old lp,<br/>hear the sound of music shatter,<br/>see the ruins of eldest beauty,<br/>once again the times remember,<br/>as you used to dance with her,<br/>around your fire.<br/><br/>Once done you can't change,<br/>that disrupted melody is shatter,<br/>your brain refuses to slow down,<br/>you think you hate your shelter,<br/>refuse to believe your eyes of crier,<br/>you're just another.<br/><br/>Victim of the heart supposed,<br/>to be your life and love and amber,<br/>do not astonish as you see the truth,<br/>you cannot now stand the shatter,<br/>as we all do this is our power,<br/>curse and flower.
