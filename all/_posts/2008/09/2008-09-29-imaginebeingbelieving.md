How could we believe,<br/>if we nearly don't know love,<br/>how could we so live?<br/><br/>How could we imagine,<br/>a world skilled into killing,<br/>when it is the one we're seeing?<br/><br/>Imagine being believing,<br/>did you hear my worlds,<br/>have you seen my words,<br/>could you manage feeling,<br/><br/>building your own rainbow,<br/>call for aid if you feel shatter,<br/>who likes you will appear better,<br/>giving death to only sorrow.
