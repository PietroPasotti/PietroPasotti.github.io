Realize it's over,<br/>it's over, we aren't any more,<br/>lover and lover<br/>as we used to dream,<br/><br/>my head is drip with scream,<br/>but we saved the world<br/>from four orphans neverborn,<br/>four more children deadly worn,<br/><br/>in the cloak of mistake,<br/>and old cap of forsake.<br/><br/>The tears blind me that's bad,<br/>last touch inside our bed it's sad,<br/>if I knew I'd have had<br/>one last smile we've never seen ahead,<br/>I'd blow up my aching head,<br/>if I didn't know I'm already dead,<br/>remember what I've said,<br/>remember where we laid.<br/><br/>All the dreams we spoke about,<br/>it's just dust and may be wrong,<br/>I can't stand so far the pang,<br/>as I think I'm now to shout,<br/><br/>I should do something to shake,<br/>from me this nothing's hell,<br/>I'm not supposed being well,<br/>and the dragon's turning snake.<br/><br/>Maybe they're right,<br/>maybe you are,<br/>a reflex of light,<br/>but we've gone so far,<br/><br/>I can't believe your mum has seen,<br/>further than us and what has been,<br/>she knows the future<br/>she knew the rupture,<br/>and knows you maybe,<br/>better than anyone could see.<br/><br/>The tears blind me that's bad,<br/>last touch inside our bed it's sad,<br/>if I knew I'd have had<br/>one last smile we've never seen ahead,<br/>I'd blow up my aching head,<br/>if I didn't know I'm already dead,<br/>remember what I've said,<br/>remember where we laid.<br/><br/>So maybe it's best like that,<br/>so maybe I wear this hat,<br/>four neverborn orphans,<br/>never gave light a chance,<br/><br/>not to be touched,<br/>not to be blamed,<br/>and into the wildest fire,<br/>they threw the birthing flower.
