Lost, frost,<br/>missing in mist,<br/>dust,<br/>I feel I've sold<br/>myself to a never<br/>returning old<br/>desire that forever<br/>I'll have.<br/><br/>A place to grow<br/>my passions,<br/>when I had no one,<br/>a place to run free<br/>when I wanted tree,<br/>a place to live away<br/>from a place that is nowaday<br/>important as my feeling<br/>now selfdestructing.
