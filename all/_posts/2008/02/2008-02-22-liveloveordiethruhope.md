In front a choiche: not wait<br/>for things to nice happen,<br/>but run towards the green,<br/>behind I have a voice: hate<br/><br/>yourself later, not today,<br/>indecision of a sadness year,<br/>passion for the fading dear,<br/>doesn't last just a single day,<br/><br/>so please help me that way<br/>finding a place to lone live<br/>that alone in this sad day,<br/><br/>finding a way to simple love<br/>cause I cannot here stay,<br/>help me find a bit of dove.
