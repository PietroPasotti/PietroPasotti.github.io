So far it doesn't leave me,<br/>so far it's still there around,<br/>I'd now what has it found,<br/>whatever it could be.<br/><br/>So late it's still over my head,<br/>a step from fallin' and standin',<br/>I just cannot avoid thinking,<br/>where that way may me lead.<br/><br/>Oh, I'd love a magic sphere,<br/>a red, crimson orb of future,<br/>to even see when or where<br/><br/>I'm gonna live this adventure,<br/>so as myself to worst prepare,<br/>and not to sign my venture.
