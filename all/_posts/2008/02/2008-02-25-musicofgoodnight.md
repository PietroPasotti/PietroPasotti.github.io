Music as a way to freedom<br/>music as a road to fun<br/>tryin to avoid martyrdom<br/>that will soon bring sun.<br/><br/>Damocles' sword,<br/>can't be avoided,<br/>with just a word,<br/>so must be singed.<br/><br/>Staring out the freezing window<br/>all I see is dark and sorrow,<br/>as the giant flying widow,<br/>leaves space for the tomorrow.<br/><br/>Is late.<br/>Is fate.
