Sometimes<br/>happens:<br/>thank you wonders,<br/>between blowing winds,<br/>someone to me way finds,<br/>and is not her,<br/>and is not there,<br/>It's just the eye storm,<br/>a peace place, warm<br/>in cold,<br/>in old,<br/>but still I cannot hold,<br/>still I feel me sold,<br/>and<br/>in the end,<br/>I know I cannot live,<br/>and I try through corals dive.
