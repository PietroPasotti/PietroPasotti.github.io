<br/>               <p>To find the unfindable,<br/>and then to leave it,<br/>not for me, would be impossible,<br/>though could be the last I meet.</p> <p>To find perfection<br/>and then to leave it<br/>may give you distruction<br/>so appeals like shit.</p> <p>To look away from love,<br/>and then to find it,<br/>is the last lost rose<br/>I'm gonna meet.</p> <p>To see it fade away,<br/>to look it go past over,<br/>I'd prefer some day<br/>not to be so sad lover.</p> <p>This sheet's so empty,<br/>this love so real,<br/>my cry will appeal<br/>this life so unhappy.</p> <p>Singin' songs in dreams,<br/>may be life,<br/>may be illusion,<br/>but like a knife,<br/>but like confusion,<br/>seems so sweet as many ice creams.</p> <p>Now so outrageous,<br/>now so far,<br/>now so jealous,<br/>so it's war.</p>       <br/>
