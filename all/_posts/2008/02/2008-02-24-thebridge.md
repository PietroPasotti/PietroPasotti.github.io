The bridge, the bridge,<br/>after seeing me true lie,<br/>is looking for revenge,<br/>as well as quickly my,<br/><br/>broken crimson sledge<br/>is gonna go through try,<br/>but I have no badge,<br/>no way to pass it by.<br/><br/>Once I reach the center,<br/>I sudden get that bridge<br/>is gonna avoid me enter<br/><br/>the witch' kingdom's edge,<br/>and no one who's singer,<br/>who like me is just a pledge,<br/><br/>can try to put upon a finger,<br/>my arrows I'm gonna fledge<br/>to force the poet to enter.
