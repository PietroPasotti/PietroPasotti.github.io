Moment, instant I didn't desire<br/>came, thank you, arrived;<br/>this is my fault, I desired,<br/>and now's the moment for fire.<br/><br/>Park's so deep, lost in time,<br/>I don't wanna enter, don't wanna come back.<br/>I wanna lose myself in rhyme,<br/>as my selfcontrol showed the biggest lack.<br/><br/>Noone can push me in,<br/>and I would like someone to<br/>pull me out of this too,<br/>what's now happenin'?<br/><br/>Wait for one, two and<br/>three minutes, pain<br/>of boiling grey sand<br/>goes thru my dry rain.
