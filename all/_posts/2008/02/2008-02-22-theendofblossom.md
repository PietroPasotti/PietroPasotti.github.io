If I were a black blossom,<br/>in a flowery greenhouse,<br/>of a white and rose lylium,<br/>cutting me may be the cause<br/><br/>of many black, rose tears<br/>of my deepest the sum,<br/>a concentrate of fears,<br/>a juice of a death gloom.<br/><br/>If I were a sad gard'ner,<br/>a scissor so sharp'n deadly,<br/>why not a flower-killer?<br/><br/>I would have cut me suddenly,<br/>shut me for a long long ever,<br/>beginning a world as rainy.
