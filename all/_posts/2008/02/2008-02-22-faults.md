I know I'll fight,<br/>for that forget,<br/>so now I regret<br/>for my high flight.<br/><br/>Sky was so blue<br/>she was so red<br/>that is all due<br/>to me, now fled.<br/><br/>I wish I couldn't think,<br/>mine or her fault was,<br/>it happened in a blink,<br/>and now no one has.<br/><br/>Flower wedding today,<br/>sudden raining, now,<br/>always crying, how?<br/>For dead loving, a day.
