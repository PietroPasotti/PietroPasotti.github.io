Now that I got it up,<br/>no way in, no way out,<br/>so I'm not gonna swap<br/>that which is all about.<br/><br/>So in the end I get it up,<br/>no way out, no way in,<br/>in my soul a so big gap,<br/>and the spirit's not within.<br/><br/>As I hope, as I fear,<br/>no way, nope, watch the real,<br/>so goodbye, my dear,<br/>no deal, I'm lost, no deal.<br/><br/>Indeed I can't rely on faith,<br/>come on mosters, fiends,<br/>wouldn't be a better threat,<br/>when now best thing ends.
