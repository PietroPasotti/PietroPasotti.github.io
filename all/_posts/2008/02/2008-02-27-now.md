<p>Now is the day when I live<br/>now is the day that I die<br/>everything seems so pale<br/>colours have gone away<br/>as I see I'll soon be alone.</p> <p>Lone, lone, less than pale,<br/>way, way, to go back away<br/>is to be ruined by me alone.</p> <p>Nonsense,<br/>everything so empty<br/>everything so grey in sad.</p> <p>Nothing to be done<br/>nothing to be explained<br/>nothing so sensible that can be tasted.</p> <p>Moonwalking in my dreams<br/>I saw a singing fairy<br/>and all of my dears<br/>ran away so quickly<br/>I couldn't see the earth any more.</p><span style="font-style: italic">Truthfully written some weeks ago...
