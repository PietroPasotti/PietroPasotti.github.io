All around the tree earth,<br/>there are many hunters,<br/>don't let em beat the singers,<br/>the only beasts with heart.<br/><br/>Let em go around, once,<br/>twice &amp; then once again<br/>you've no to lose, all to gain<br/>they'll fly over the fence,<br/><br/>reach all people, all wars,<br/>bring a light with bright,<br/>that only can give flight,<br/>that may not give roars,<br/><br/>So give doves wider places<br/>to fly around and give out flies<br/>to in the end give out smiles<br/>to live and see our faces<br/><br/>So do not hunt down peacocks,<br/>let em give world a bit of honour,<br/>a pale and thin trace of colour,<br/>they just live upon wide rocks,<br/><br/>And last thing let by pheasant,<br/>see their tails,<br/>live their tales,<br/>which could be so much important.<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">To everyone who believes a rifle is better than a kiss.</span>
