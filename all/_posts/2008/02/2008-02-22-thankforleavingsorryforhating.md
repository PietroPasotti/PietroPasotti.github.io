I know that may seem strange<br/>some day I thought you made,<br/>not for love but for revenge,<br/>some so sharp as a blade.<br/><br/>I thought a day your was emotion<br/>not me but your best friends<br/>was it illusion, was it confusion,<br/>I saw them as cruel fiends.<br/><br/>I regret but couldn't prevent<br/>me to hate without knowing<br/>call it envy, but I not pretend<br/>to justify what I've been doing.<br/><br/>After all it seemed to me<br/>that yours no cruel was<br/>intended at all to be<br/><br/>and that all of yours has<br/>tried to be just as the<br/>good girl, wonder geishas.<br/><br/>Have you seen the future?<br/>Have you understood the failure?<br/>Or am I trying to justify<br/>for my so sad sad cry?<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">To the only one.</span>
