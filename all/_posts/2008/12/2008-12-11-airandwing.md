Oh so now it seems my dear,<br/>blowing leaves upon the wind,<br/>standing up as I'm getting near,<br/>you my air, you my air and wing;<br/><br/>time to learn again to fly,<br/>you teach me we're full of fear,<br/>but we can beat and we will shy,<br/>dread of noise and pain beware;<br/><br/>you my air and wing,<br/>within us we kill pain<br/>with just a slim sling,<br/><br/>to show our wounds are not in vain,<br/>to show ourselves we made it being,<br/>to show me I can love again...
