There's no blame, no shame,<br/>but you burn as a flame,<br/>and I hope it's not the same:<br/>so far I've beaten fate,<br/>my hand with you forever mate,<br/>I look your eyes no it's too late,<br/>future is not here to rate,<br/>and we will see as comes our date,<br/>and we will see if is love's fame,<br/>or illusion of the same flame.<br/><br/>But I believe<br/>and we will live and we will love,<br/>and this time I'm not to leave,<br/>and this tree will flowers give,<br/>and I will try to you forgive,<br/>but there's no blame or shame,<br/>so it's all fault of my flame,<br/>forgive me,<br/>I won't just see.
