It's just a step, a jump to avoid<br/>a gap, a bump, to touch<br/>what cannot be, so it's tough<br/>to resist, stand still, now mermaid<br/><br/>swim so deep you can't be caught,<br/>hide where I cannot see you,<br/>so I can do what you me taught,<br/>to live without you through<br/><br/>years and time, clock is running,<br/>quickly passing, realizing now<br/>just three months last, how,<br/><br/>am I supposed to hold on, breathing<br/>without lighter you give me air,<br/>feelin just your sadness' heir?
