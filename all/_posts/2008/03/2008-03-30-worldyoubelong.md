Trying to look world you belong,<br/>that rainbowed happy place,<br/>I'm afraid doing something wrong<br/><br/>and am even terrified moving along,<br/>I'd never dare you embrace,<br/>cause I know you hate yourself among.<br/><br/>So leave this new sad song<br/>fly out and shout about<br/>this terrible period so long<br/><br/>that I'm living, hit the gong,<br/>and use and cry your mouth,<br/>any more lifebound with thong.
