Now has been what had to be,<br/>now I'm ready to be free,<br/>look around and the truth see,<br/>and owe all to who opened me,<br/><br/>showing ways to move the life,<br/>to change and like the alive,<br/>and no brave, as no one's slave,<br/>just as other she's world's rife.<br/><br/>As usual I'm trying to myselves<br/>tricky and silly, slowly joke,<br/>and trying to see in orcs and elves<br/><br/>what through me as knife broke<br/>what I used to be and feel in halves<br/>which will never meet and fuse, I fake.
