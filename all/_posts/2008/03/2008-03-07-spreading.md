What would I do?<br/>Would have I been so<br/>cruel and moody,<br/>to switch and rely,<br/><br/>two seconds, two different,<br/>and hungry for content,<br/>friends and lovers, people,<br/>who you know. Breakable<br/><br/>like me shouldn't be<br/>left alone within me,<br/>couldn't think of being<br/>like I am, less than living.<br/><br/>Envy, I don't think is it,<br/>call it a cry, I cannot survive with,<br/>but I suffer, please I beg,<br/>try to be constant and reg,<br/><br/>plain as white water,<br/>as you know I need,<br/>try to get I'm now stalker<br/>and of me grow up the seed.<br/><br/>Is now falling a spread<br/>of colours, tryin to cover<br/>your blank face beneath<br/>which stand still the lover.<br/><br/>Is now Feeling enemies<br/>as occasions to do atrocities<br/>that I would never have<br/>done or even thought, behave,<br/><br/>I cannot even stand<br/>in front of myself' strand<br/>in inside of crying outside,<br/>and watch me cryin ride.
