If you see<br/>sudden my eyes get dark<br/>and wet,<br/>you know it's due to shark<br/>I met,<br/><br/>if you see<br/>in a snap my head go down<br/>and slow,<br/>realize I've just shown<br/>my darkest glow.<br/><br/>It's a period of fears and little<br/>short moments made of black,<br/>sometimes in me's a rifle<br/>towards heart shoot attack.<br/><br/>I'm not gonna sing I think these times<br/>to mine appeal stop beating,<br/>but I know I'd like not breathing,<br/>when the light goes off sometimes.
