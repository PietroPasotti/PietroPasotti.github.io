If this is it, here's love,<br/>don't you like it? I can say<br/>in the most strange way,<br/>that's what I'm made of,<br/><br/>and that I'm hating it and me.<br/>Spitting down the way I ache,<br/>throwing up what could even be,<br/>alone fighting my inner quake.<br/><br/>All I can is pulse and beat,<br/>but all I get is none and empty,<br/>I don't believe it'd be a cheat.<br/><br/>All I want is a bit of pretty<br/>pity and sympathy, just because<br/>I'm like a burning little ditty.
