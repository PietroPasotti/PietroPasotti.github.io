Placid, calm and slow,<br/>never seemed so low<br/>my eyes instead<br/>of looking dead<br/>now watch empty<br/>as I think is pity,<br/>shame of mine and<br/>yours, exploring outer land,<br/>which is lonelessy. Brave<br/>now look at me<br/>and simply try to see<br/>through veil and imagination<br/>the outclaiming wet reduction<br/>that's suffering my brain<br/>in vain.<br/><br/>Pathology inexisting<br/>for a dead incoming<br/>walking resolution<br/>for a non-existing execution.<br/><br/>Exec the black<br/>and reveal white<br/>so now seem lite<br/>ready to backtack.
