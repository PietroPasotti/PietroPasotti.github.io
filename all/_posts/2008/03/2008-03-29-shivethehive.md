<div style="text-align: left">Feeling something back today<br/>feeling something's up to be<br/>and I am not ready to the<br/>big bill, price in end to pay.<br/><br/>Isn't that getting nearer<br/>just to see me and then leaves<br/>but remember that like leaves<br/>in autumn is my heart and her,<br/><br/>so shave,<br/>shove,<br/>shive the hive,<br/>for the moment up to arrive.<br/><br/>It's not a game.<br/>It's a long tragedy<br/>that I don't wanna play<br/>but I have to today,<br/>and I'll have to pay.<br/>I am to blame.<br/><br/>I cannot trust<br/>the ones who think<br/>we could exist even far<br/><br/>away and that dust<br/>may let pass the blink,<br/>and may let see the star.<br/><br/>So shave,<br/>shove,<br/>shive the hive,<br/>for the moment up to arrive.<br/><br/>
