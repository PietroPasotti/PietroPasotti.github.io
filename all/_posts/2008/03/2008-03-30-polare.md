Is this that new sensation,<br/>is this the only station<br/>lost in space in deep and far,<br/>you have lost the way to star,<br/><br/>and no one's got so wrong,<br/>so out of well-known ways,<br/>and nothing is where stays,<br/>all in chaos of singing song.<br/><br/>That place could appear safer,<br/>a placid place to sleep sure,<br/>but even here and more and more,<br/><br/>you realize you could be better<br/>and you deserve some best<br/>space for a black and silent rest.
