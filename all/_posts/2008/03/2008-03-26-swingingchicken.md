Swing around as soon you can,<br/>jump and fly whenever you want,<br/>don't sense world around, cause<br/>truth hurts and as well you do,<br/>you're not one of few, not rose<br/>I aim to see, not in through<br/>myself and me, sense you can't<br/>do anything but run.<br/><br/>See you're less than you could be<br/>see you're not more than wolves<br/>want chickens to be, and<br/>in the very end,<br/>realize you're not in hopes<br/>of anyone in this world but me.<br/><br/>You tried to be me and who<br/>you thought<br/>being the best around us all<br/>and I tried and taught<br/>you how to stand and not to fall<br/>but was futile in front of you.<br/><br/>Sorry, oh most hated dear<br/><br/>friend, don't expect from me<br/>tears, cause all I want is not to see<br/>you more, in life or death you<br/>and isn't that<br/>what<br/>you wanted too?<br/><br/>Swing until the end,<br/>avoid the world in its best<br/>and least,<br/>don't realize you're losing it and<br/><br/>go on.<br/>You've not won.<br/><br/><span>To the swinging chicken, who made me better, in a stubborn way thinking he was. Remember what I said, what you couldn't deny and that I wasn't wrong. Grow up and open eyes.</span>
