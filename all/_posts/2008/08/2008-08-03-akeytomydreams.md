I'd wanna give you a key,<br/>to my dreams,<br/>I'd wanna make you yours as you've done,<br/>with me,<br/><br/>and if we are what we'd like,<br/>both to be,<br/>and if we really love and this is,<br/>how we live,<br/><br/>then we'd fill the sea<br/>and all of mountains,<br/>then I'd be lightning,<br/>by your side till the horizon.<br/><br/>In your hands steam becomes water.<br/><br/>As a key to my dreams,<br/>you may open both my eyes,<br/>and if they're electric as they seem to be,<br/>then you'll read my mind as a faceless book.<br/><br/>In your eyes tears look more like pearls.<br/><br/>Wave your hands once again,<br/>to make the wolves bow their own,<br/>do not cry again, never,<br/>to watch me own my fever.<br/><br/>And once again make your eyes shiny.
