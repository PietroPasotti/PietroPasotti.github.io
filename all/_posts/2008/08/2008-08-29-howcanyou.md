How can you mirror,<br/>how can you see you live,<br/>after seeing me cry my horror,<br/>after having hit the dove?<br/><br/>I couldn't say,<br/>how would be if I did so,<br/>I must deny,<br/>if you say something wrong,<br/><br/>going along this situation,<br/>I feel falling's the solution,<br/>instead of fighting myself,<br/>instead of releasing the wolf.<br/><br/>May seem wrong but here's the love,<br/>all you could offer to see crawl a dove.
