<div style="text-align: left">I feel empty and tears can't fill me,<br/>as I'm alone and sad once more,<br/>and I can't see the root of sore,<br/>I won't get any flower from this tree,<br/><br/>seed was mine and broken is,<br/>sometimes I'm light but not now,<br/>and may seem useless, thanks I bow,<br/>without you any dream's to freeze.<br/><br/>Do not think now I'm another,<br/>I'm the same and perhaps worse,<br/>for my heart I'll look further,<br/><br/>when my own looks like a curse,<br/>and I'm even afraid really harder,<br/>do not astonish as you'll see the corpse.<br/><br/>
