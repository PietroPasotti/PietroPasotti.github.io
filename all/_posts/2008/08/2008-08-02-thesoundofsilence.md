This was sound,<br/>I just saw your lips moving,<br/>that was a Silence,<br/>a waste of sound,<br/><br/>what was this sound of silence?<br/>I could almost see it come,<br/>I nearly touched the Silence,<br/>and then that sound.<br/><br/>And then like bolts,<br/>into my breathing heart,<br/>came a meaning made of no words,<br/><br/>thousands smiles,<br/>millions silent kisses,<br/>and your lips whispered me hope.
