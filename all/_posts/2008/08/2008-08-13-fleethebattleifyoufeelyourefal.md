When the bows get cannon pills,<br/>when to swords you've only pillows,<br/><br/>flee the battle if you feel you're falling,<br/>flee the land if you can keep flying,<br/>flee the life if you'd rather die.<br/><br/>When the rainbow you were building,<br/>seems to fail in front of suffering,<br/>to overkill your own misery,<br/>you have to chase a different dream.<br/><br/>When the heart is lying dead,<br/>just keep dancing to see it beat,<br/><br/>flee the battle if you feel you're falling,<br/>flee the life if you don't feel worth being.<br/>Flee it all.<br/><br/>But will be happy who you leave behind?<br/>Will feel lone who you only had?<br/>Feel sad who you only saw?<br/>Sad now even my heart...<br/>Now everybody'd say me no.<br/>Everybody?
