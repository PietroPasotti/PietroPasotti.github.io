Oh, what a beautiful smile,<br/>you can draw under your eyes,<br/><br/>and even if only for a while,<br/>I can taste some happiness,<br/>it won't be the same,<br/>any more in future,<br/>and who is now to blame,<br/>who is going to rupture?<br/><br/>Oh, what a beautiful smile,<br/>even if only for a while,<br/><br/>you can paint upon my eyes,<br/>even if I'm crying now,<br/>you can make me live somehow,<br/>you can make laugh who cries.
