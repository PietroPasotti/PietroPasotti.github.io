Did you know,<br/>who I am and who should be,<br/><br/>did you know,<br/>they should be able,<br/>to cast a silver cloud upon your face,<br/>to hide you world,<br/>and hide your eyes to who shan't see,<br/><br/>and somehow the crystal,<br/>made of you and all of lesser,<br/>should be allowed just to children,<br/><br/>did you know,<br/>just an empty face may stay,<br/><br/>did you know,<br/>anyone would bow his head,<br/>and blind his eyes,<br/>as a vow to the fairy mermaid.<br/><br/>Did I think,<br/>for only instants,<br/>to understand this power,<br/><br/>did I even wonder,<br/>for only instants,<br/>that if world may not I may not too,<br/>that I am to bow to you.<br/><br/>Did you think<br/>someone with a face built in tears,<br/>would a day cry his eyes to your own,<br/><br/>did you?
