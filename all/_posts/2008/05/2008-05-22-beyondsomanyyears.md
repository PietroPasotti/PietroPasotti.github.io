Whose illusion am I living now,<br/>trespassing right barrier of sound,<br/>years seem useless in number's ground<br/>and so many tears are there, how?<br/><br/>If I was crying I'd have drowned,<br/>so sad and I'm still standing to scream,<br/>who's gone is in peaceful dream,<br/>in clouds maybe but's not so cursed,<br/><br/>and so who's written so much to love<br/>just got another heir and I'm not<br/>proud. Here it is the blame, heave<br/><br/>is full to me, he'll get me not.<br/>Still in me's sign of surviving, wave<br/>striking thru harmony that's not.
