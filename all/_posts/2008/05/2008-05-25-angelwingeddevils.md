As we try more and more to step out<br/>of that homes, here we get from<br/>angelwinged devils the bit of wisdom,<br/>just enough to keep us here about.<br/>And will we,<br/>won't we thank you for your kindness,<br/>cause our illness' not controlled,<br/>and may spread out from you to died,<br/>this won't be allowed from our blindness.<br/><br/>Is not of this world gratitude it seem<br/>and we do we cannot so far make through<br/>our tough hearts covered in scars that you<br/>saved fading life, saved suicidal self-esteem.<br/><br/>So sorry son, wounding you will be<br/>the most complaint to biggest mountain<br/>to cry out to world and let fall the rain<br/>as we'll cry together once again you and me.
