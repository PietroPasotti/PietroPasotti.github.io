Crisis now, no can't be,<br/>breakdown in my doldrums,<br/>every single atom in dumps<br/>says every second to me:<br/><br/>heave heave shake me now,<br/>let me take again in hands control<br/>of me and inner one, about to fall<br/>and to one, to one alone I bow.<br/><br/>What a peaceful harmony<br/>that can be my way out<br/>of thus breaking fallout<br/>that otherwise will make me cry.<br/><br/>Heave heave take me away,<br/>pave my path to numbness,<br/>show me to keep you out of mess<br/>that's in my life and in my way,<br/><br/>it's a long avenue to be run<br/>but together now we still,<br/>we really with power will<br/>break out and I know we can.<br/><br/>Heave heave so far hideout<br/>you must not be afraid of me,<br/>I'm here for you to shout,<br/>I am there for you to see<br/><br/>you're not ready to set me free,<br/>you cannot embrace my life,<br/>you may not purchase my wife,<br/>will not get me till's on my tree.
