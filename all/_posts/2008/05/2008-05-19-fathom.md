Fathom fathom fading phantom,<br/>why is the breeze keeping you up<br/>sudden fading in frozen breaths,<br/>why is your essence slipping out<br/><br/>of your pale hands unseen,<br/>why are you being betrayed by<br/>your own faith that turns only now<br/>to its true cruel last shape.<br/><br/>Stop all of that stupid doing,<br/>wait a second and hold your<br/>screams, drown the wicked<br/><br/>who wants you shout out<br/>all of you, in some strange way.<br/>Is that even possible? Maybe.
