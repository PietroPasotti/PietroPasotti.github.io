You should not get dark your<br/>eyes, just because so far they<br/>seem to be, happy, mine only<br/>reason for walking, and dour<br/><br/>I'm gonna cripple in impotency;<br/>Cannot keep in my mind when<br/>broken, broken, sadness token<br/>came and showed off my frailty.<br/><br/>Now later plop on my table<br/>I proof myself once again<br/>that I've never ran out<br/><br/>of tears, that I've found out<br/>once for all that to strive gain<br/>I've no longer nimbus of fable.
