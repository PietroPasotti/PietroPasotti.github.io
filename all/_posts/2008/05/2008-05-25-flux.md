As I try more,and more to step<br/>out of that home, here I get<br/>the passion thank to you<br/>and I don't know whether getting hating<br/>who tore off with setting<br/>traps me, unknown pilgrim pleading<br/>a taste of peace. Or not.<br/>So I am and so are you.<br/>Why did you<br/>try to share your being, did you<br/>want to lend a slice of so huge essence,<br/>just to keep me alive.<br/>I did not deserve and not do to live,<br/>I reject life and all of its stuff,<br/>I cannot any more stand, and so you saved me.<br/>Is it a fault is it some good,<br/>by now cannot thank you, I'm willing<br/>to hate myself and you learn me to love,<br/>I'm willing to breakout and you<br/>bind me down to knees.<br/>How could I?<br/>One day I'll do, but not today.<br/>One day I'll pay you back,<br/>but you'll have forgotten<br/>or I'll have died, making pieces of your wishes.<br/>Here I am and you can hit me,<br/>though please hug me up now.
