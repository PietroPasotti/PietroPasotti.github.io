I've learned to treasure,<br/>and I'm sure<br/>it will turn out to be useful<br/>when I'll be alone on night's shore,<br/>when will come the day for me full<br/>to learn<br/>the many types of love<br/>we might live,<br/>and finally to earn<br/>from licking my wounds.<br/><br/>So many pounds of grieving<br/>iron, still binding me down,<br/>still about to get my killing<br/>and my murder as I've shown,<br/>reveal now order.<br/><br/>Clean up the crashes<br/> as these planes fell down,<br/>just not to see mothers cry<br/> and burst into tears,<br/>let them own, as they<br/>wish, when they do, their fears,<br/>just not to make them sad.<br/><br/>Are we right isn't it bad<br/>to force the drops come out<br/>of clouds, as the lightning<br/>may still to you defenceless break<br/>even if sky is enlightening,<br/>when we can almost see white peak.
