Why do I miss you like that<br/>used to be my only question,<br/>but from that weird day in midair on<br/>taking off eagle was slashed by cat,<br/>and since it couldn't have won,<br/>surrendered and that's the done<br/>and the reason of cycling what.<br/><br/>This origin has been suffering<br/>turned into ending in a flash,<br/>and just as fire turns into ash,<br/>I got burned from my own doing<br/>and so screaming into water splash,<br/>turning off the power seeming dash<br/>to simple sand made of rocks crunching.<br/><br/>I swear I didn't know this moor<br/>was so infested and full of spirits,<br/>I swear I used before to know it's<br/>unknown, it's out of steel door<br/>I cannot blast opened as fits,<br/>so get stuck where madness meets<br/>conscience, and so I fell to floor.<br/><br/>Would you have the strength,<br/>the wisdom to turn to translight<br/>this huge amount of dull fight<br/>I am to bear? What if you're asked<br/>from a day to another and might<br/>happen,  to abandon dreams right<br/>now, what if you get alone unmended?
