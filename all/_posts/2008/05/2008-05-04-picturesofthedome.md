This may not be life but her sister,<br/>let's try to get something better:<br/>this is what I said<br/>and there is where it laid,<br/>and there is only a place like<br/>every other, near a lake<br/>so black you can't mirror,<br/>you cannot taste its flavour<br/>because it's too rough,<br/>and to understand its bluff<br/>you can only keep trying<br/>to break the shadow yelling.<br/><br/>There's no need to explain<br/>to me I hope, the reason for my pain,<br/>so far I explored<br/>myself and near exploded<br/>in wondering what am I made of,<br/>but still the deepness flees off<br/>and leaves me bare behind<br/>the veil of soul mute and blind,<br/>despite that thousand ways shroud<br/>in front of my feet, and aloud<br/>crying boy reminding afraid<br/>what his heart himself once said.<br/><br/>Help help, no now go away,<br/>please I'm afraid no I'm okay,<br/>nonsenses produced by fusions<br/>of many minds and emotions<br/>into only one glass body<br/>and the frail one it's to embody,<br/>the burning mask it's to wear,<br/>screaming voice it's to bear,<br/>from the inside tore off to pieces<br/>in the end only desiring friendly faces<br/>in white hall which is its mind's home<br/>which is about to become a dome.<br/><br/>To Dome's builders. Thank you.
