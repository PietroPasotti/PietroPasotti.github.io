I ran and sweat in midnight air,<br/>and let cold air open my arms<br/>till blood.<br/><br/>I stood<br/>one day more what for, charms<br/>I got hit by weren't here but far,<br/><br/>usual angels with golden faces<br/>smiled me once more sadly,<br/>and I, and I,<br/><br/>cry<br/>once more and I was haired madly<br/>and drenched, flashes, bolts, tyres.<br/><br/>Am I so stupid that last day,<br/>last night only I know what to do,<br/>and I know<br/><br/>dunno how,<br/>that who's been and is right was you,<br/>but indeed from now on where to lie.<br/><br/>And maybe aiming death with<br/>lightened eyes, still echoes<br/>in my ears<br/><br/>and fears<br/>astonishing my heart, still shoes<br/>to clamp my feet to earth, oh stop it.
