As before, again,<br/>I got thinking drip with rain,<br/>and as I passed trees' whip,<br/>with vines my eyes were torn off<br/>and I could see what's all made of.<br/><br/>I saw a boy full of the others<br/>and empty of himself,<br/>I saw the water, the life<br/>and green one, I stared<br/>once more at power<br/>coming to its end,<br/>and I knew,<br/>I knew that my drop's about<br/>to step out,<br/>to the top made in fallout,<br/>so it can be seen in nights,<br/>when yellow discovers<br/>concealed mights.
