I'm sad and more by nature<br/>and I may even drive sun to failure,<br/>so I'm afraid of any dream,<br/>and everything that seems a beam,<br/><br/>and the more I know life's face,<br/>the more I hate my cowardice,<br/>what has been my fault has been,<br/>and how that's awful I've seen,<br/><br/>but that's about me and I'm not<br/>ready so I'm gonna break<br/>my heart in blames<br/><br/>and bury myself in flames,<br/>as my own world's brick<br/>is gonna crush after the shot.
