Here's a tale,<br/>a secret mail,<br/>sure I can't fail<br/>as my heart's in jail,<br/><br/>getting nearer,<br/>thinking clearer,<br/>staring at something<br/>behind reach,<br/>something rich.<br/><br/>Colour rivers,<br/>rainbow flowers,<br/>love and peace,<br/>peace and life,<br/>my outreach wife...<br/><br/>Doesn't matter,<br/>just grow fatter,<br/>true life is under butter!<br/><br/>Dream's over,<br/>burned cover,<br/>here's a carbon forest,<br/>and the end of our rest.
