The black parade<br/>is showing his mantles to the wind,<br/>what's been made<br/>may not be given, if you find<br/><br/>something they<br/>would accept, just then<br/>you'll be asked to say<br/>sorry boys for where and when.<br/><br/>It's place and time<br/>for a long red wooden suit<br/>and again and over I just keep in mine<br/>the fear of it,<br/><br/>and only this cloud thin<br/>is gonna longer keep me<br/>from sun's form but then<br/>one day what's me will be.<br/><br/>Two or three nice steamy<br/>voices avoid me to take hard choices<br/>but they all know one day<br/>I'll need them all or I'll be ashes.
