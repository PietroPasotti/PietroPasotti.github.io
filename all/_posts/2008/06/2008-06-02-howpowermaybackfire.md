Do not force the dove itself<br/>to go down to field and fight<br/>your weak body and dread light,<br/>understand the wrong by yourself.<br/><br/>You do not hold the right to step over<br/>any flower like so much she is,<br/>any lover and look now at this:<br/>I won't let you this beauty cover.<br/><br/>Underneath the iron lair<br/>I'm pulling to own all of me,<br/>I swear there is still a fair<br/><br/>power, enough to kill who we<br/>both have become, any chair<br/>will collapse under your heart you'll see.
