I write to you,<br/>this night as ones before,<br/>I wrote you about my dreams,<br/>now's time for the seashore.<br/><br/>Oh dear my Syren,<br/>the ocean's so deep,<br/>but into your heart<br/>any world you can keep,<br/><br/>Oh dear my Syren,<br/>how long has it been,<br/>too much and just now,<br/>I watch what I've seen,<br/><br/>Oh dear my Syren,<br/>we haven't much time,<br/>but if yours is good,<br/>please take all of mine,<br/><br/>Oh dear my Syren,<br/>this was really soon,<br/>and I wasn't ready<br/>or we'd now have the moon,<br/><br/>Oh dear my wonder,<br/>how did you do,<br/>you made me better<br/>and deeper like you,<br/><br/>Oh dear my Syren,<br/>I may be to swim away,<br/>but now or somewhen else<br/>we'll side to side stay,<br/><br/>Oh dear my Syren,<br/>since sea is your home,<br/>I bet you'd have power<br/>to set him new name,<br/><br/>Oh dear my Syren,<br/>since you're so much,<br/>I finally know why<br/>you make gold what you touch,<br/><br/>and now dear my Syren,<br/>goodbye or hello,<br/>we'll see altogether<br/>where we'll be to go.<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">To Serena.</span>
