I wasn't more and you people<br/>should have known,<br/>I had to be an eagle<br/>to see my forest had been blown,<br/><br/>and now searching the ashes,<br/>realize no glue can keep,<br/>and flying from the flashes<br/>of incoming storm, in deep<br/><br/>I am Dragon. What was it if<br/>not desire I couldn't say,<br/>but still now from that far day<br/><br/>I am owned and from the cliff<br/>I wanna throw myself into drown<br/>and it's said I'm to fall down.
