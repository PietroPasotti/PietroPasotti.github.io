To feel again you're living for,<br/>to taste again you're necessary,<br/>so far I hadn't and had bury,<br/>and the drowning touched shore,<br/><br/>and since I'm dragon my shape<br/>can change but if you're love<br/>I may be to be your only dove<br/>and we may be each other's hope.<br/><br/>I'd been afraid of dreaming<br/>so I had't been able<br/>to keep long fighting<br/><br/>but now I hope this table<br/>may witness my thinking,<br/>as I know we're here as fable,<br/><br/>since we're syren and dragoon,<br/>and I'd fly you to the moon,<br/><br/>since we're dragoon and syren,<br/>and you'll swim me to believing.
