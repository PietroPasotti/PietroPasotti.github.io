Since you're afraid,<br/>of your own shadow, mermaid,<br/>onto the basement of the sea,<br/>you ask who sings then here it's me,<br/><br/>think you'd better eat mouth wide<br/>don't you try to pride what you hide,<br/>not to make your heart collide...<br/><br/>Bells upon the sky,<br/>you didn't think she could be lie,<br/>make the snow dance up in the air,<br/>try to jump off merging chair,<br/><br/>you sat down trusting who lied,<br/>don't you try to pride what you hide,<br/>not to make your heart collide...<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">To every afraid one...</span>
