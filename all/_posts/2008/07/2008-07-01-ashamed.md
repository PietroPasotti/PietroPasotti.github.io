I wanna ask,<br/>beg and plead any miserable in this world<br/>as they were happy before my dreams came true,<br/>as they were safe before my fire came hot,<br/>as they were themselves after dragoon came out.<br/><br/>People says I'm to be here,<br/>my inner says I'm to go away,<br/>forever and ever I won't stay,<br/>but I'll have to go nowhere,<br/><br/>since my heart bent me to trees,<br/>since my brain bent me to life,<br/>since it's all due to my own wife,<br/>since we're each other's tears.<br/><br/>Tears of love and tears of pain,<br/>we'd destroy the world in rain,<br/>tears of melanchony and of sadness,<br/>we'd all like to burn in madness.
