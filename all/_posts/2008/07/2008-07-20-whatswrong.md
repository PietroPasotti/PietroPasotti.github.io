It seems we're so happy,<br/>it seems I can fly,<br/>for the first time ever...<br/><br/>What's wrong?<br/><br/>It seems it's me again,<br/>watching a syren,<br/>and asking myself what's wrong.<br/><br/>What's wrong?<br/><br/>Am I to live first now<br/>and I am bruising,<br/>this wonderful time and place.<br/><br/>What's wrong?<br/><br/>We gave us all,<br/>she's all that I want,<br/>but I am not the same.<br/><br/>What's wrong?<br/><br/>She chose me,<br/>in the whole world,<br/>she's so high and chose me.<br/><br/>What's wrong?<br/><br/>We need to be happy,<br/>but am I able<br/>to keep these lives running?<br/><br/>What's wrong?<br/><br/>She says she loves me,<br/>but I can't keep myself asking<br/>whether I am or not.<br/><br/>What's wrong?<br/><br/>And so in the end,<br/>I'm as ever able to<br/>cover the brightest sky.<br/><br/>That's wrong... So so wrong.
