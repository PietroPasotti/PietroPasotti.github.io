Was I tired was I afraid,<br/>no can't be I were well laid,<br/>was I tired was I so shook,<br/>well maybe I missed the hook,<br/><br/>so someday will be again,<br/>I'll be asked this love rain,<br/>someday will I fail once more,<br/>or will I reach what got me tore.<br/><br/>You're living, you're living,<br/>keep on what you're saying,<br/>sad and under an iron sky,<br/><br/>stop asking so stupidly why,<br/>and find a way not to fail that time,<br/>no can't be just this useless rhyme.
