I've been waiting for the end to come<br/>but really never wanted to<br/>and now, and now<br/>the forever has come, has come<br/>but we already bent away.<br/><br/>Soon we all realise<br/>we want some things to go<br/>we need a clean sign to be traced<br/>and something to be made,<br/>soon we all turn off<br/>and wind shakes he shakes<br/>sweeping away our dead leaves<br/>our rust hopes<br/>our needless reasons<br/>and it will be too late.
