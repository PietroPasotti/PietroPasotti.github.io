<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left">I believe in what I see, and I cannot see your eyes.<br/>Long ago my teeth were sharp<br/>long ago my eyes were clean<br/>I used to stare at starry skies, until the tears fed up my lungs.<br/><br/>Now and ever air is thin, not thin enough for me;<br/>sometimes I wish my hands could climb<br/>right in the nowhere where no one goes<br/>right in the unknown where no feet wanders,<br/><br/>you smile with the same clean emptiness<br/>you used to cry with,<br/>I'm an empty vase<br/>I'm the carpark north&nbsp;and a crate<br/>come and seed me<br/>I need to be punished<br/>I need to be washed and cleaned<br/>maybe wasted or confused;<br/><br/>long I hoped for air to thicken<br/>I'd give her all of my density<br/>my faith unlimited would hold up all<br/>still clouds would rain always in the same places<br/>and I'd look forever into frozen silences.<br/>
