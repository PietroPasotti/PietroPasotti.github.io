We lost, indeed<br/>in the end<br/>behind a bent<br/>elation mist<br/>has made us blind<br/>with none to look for<br/>who else will find,<br/>and in the end<br/>behind a bent<br/>a fiery path<br/>a lustful cup of desert<br/>isn't this a tower we smile to?<br/>A round rock gray wall<br/>I hit and hit find nothing to hurt<br/>and nothing to suffer for<br/>have all of my tears fallen in vain?<br/>Have I still something to cry for?<br/>We lost, indeed and in the end<br/>where no more wounds to mend<br/>still smile at us defeated <br/>my heart black sun depleted.
