O dear bloody lady,<br/>today we begin a tale<br/>I'll tell you this moment<br/>will never be the same<br/><br/>I've spent a whole life<br/>saying the same words<br/>I'm old and sick<br/>and death gives no rewards;<br/><br/>O dear bloody lady<br/>once there was a boy<br/><br/>a boy.<br/>I'd hate to say<br/>the story ends<br/>but that's the way it goes,<br/>I'd hate to say<br/>he chose not to become<br/>but that's the way it goes,<br/><br/>O lady bloody lady, lady,<br/>round things tend to roll away<br/>and wallowed in the mud his steady legs<br/>for he wasn't made to run<br/>wallowed in the mud his eyes<br/>for he had nothing else to see,<br/>he wallowed in the mud himself<br/>for he wasnt enough at all<br/>and wallowed in the mud his heart<br/>for nothing he could trespass<br/>all limits bent away<br/><br/>he had to face the nothing,<br/>he had -to be- the nowhere<br/><br/>and felt the mist <br/>into his opened chest<br/>and rose a rose<br/>to no one's nest<br/>he lies he chose<br/>not to resist.
