The trees have grown<br/>no more,<br/>belown the gown of sem<br/>their faithless lifeless spots<br/>to deserts turned at once.<br/>A point blank death<br/>came walking all along<br/>this futile barren thing<br/>is burning like a sting;<br/>what for you wrote a song<br/>my barren lord<br/>of Silent Walls.<br/>Have I seen nothing for too long?<br/>The barren song have written I?<br/>These well-damp eyes<br/>drowning in a face<br/>of dead-dark dye<br/>barren songs is all we have.
