<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left">I can almost feel<br/>this naturally won't heal<br/>I'm no longer on my feet<br/>they're drowning all the fleet<br/>my words have won the battle<br/>our ironclads were bigger<br/>the wood has sunk<br/>the glass together<br/>I fear the ships are lost forever<br/><br/><br/>nobody will be alone<br/>when face to face with darkness<br/>not anymore<br/>our crazy bursts, hangovers<br/>are no weight at all<br/>they're nothing but leftovers<br/>my love will sweep away.<br/><br/>
