<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left">In a liquid restoration<br/>hang a grace of words<br/>like many silly spiders<br/>fight to survive to life;<br/>mournful pale dancers<br/>are to come and pray for pain;<br/>many lambs instead of soldiers<br/>will be slain in vain<br/>isn't this a way for clay<br/>to cover up the rainy day<br/>a fatal sign of calm and rage<br/>when empty covers fill a hole<br/>and time has come to turn the page<br/>and find the name to make a whole.<br/>
