<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left">Shaking shaking windy roots<br/>all ashamed the oaks were born<br/>shaking shaking what we knew<br/>all the earth herserlf was torn<br/><br/>releasing golden steam<br/>burning our thick stem<br/>she kept speaking grumbling voice<br/>our black ground had made its choice<br/><br/>and this is what I call<br/>take-the best of<br/>me.<br/><br/>And this is what I call<br/>take-the best of<br/>me.<br/><br/>When the earth is torn<br/>the clouds were born<br/>and then they spread along the skies<br/>they reached our homes and made us die.<br/><br/>And this is what I call<br/>take-the best of<br/>me.<br/>
