<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left">The nucleus<br/>is answering to stimuli<br/>the orders are suddenly getting over<br/>are freaking out<br/>are the only ones<br/>the only reasons left online<br/>the curves are bending softer<br/>the schemes are getting visible<br/>the grid has fallen on us<br/>and all the electricity is getting over me<br/>this mechanical sounds and landscapes<br/>are like a vision to my round eyes<br/>no round corner can be found<br/>in my world of angles<br/>in my world of angers<br/>and dark tapestry<br/>I'm only answering the stimuli.<br/>
