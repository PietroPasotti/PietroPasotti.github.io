Seeds everywhere<br/>are spreading on the wind,<br/>seeds are everywhere<br/>and sing along with spring<br/><br/>seeds do often ask<br/>for answers unaware<br/>we can't help and<br/>shake our cheeks<br/><br/>something someday<br/>will decide and pray for us<br/>instead of the diamond rain<br/>he'll come and bless the cause.<br/><br/>Then seeds will be<br/>ready to lift and thrive<br/>without a single drop<br/>of what's called love.
