A grain of sand can bleed enough<br/>anything can suffer me away<br/><br/>a hilltop sits me around<br/>a tree blossoms up from shaky ground<br/><br/>my love I'm here no more<br/>the footsteps echo the desert hallways<br/>nothing between me and the sun<br/><br/>I can see nothing but burned weeds<br/>a careless mind keeps pulling me<br/>be gentle, for my arm is strong<br/>but my heart is trembling<br/>and my mind is wrong.<br/><br/>Sailing unknown destinies<br/>cubes and cavities float by<br/>forsaken spaces I inhabit<br/>cursing them further<br/>with unholy thoughts<br/><br/>entirely made of stone<br/>at the center of the cone<br/>close my eyes and fill my shape<br/>dead I dangle down the slope.
