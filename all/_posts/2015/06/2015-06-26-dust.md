One day<br/>I'll wake up and see<br/>that all I have is dust<br/>and time was missing<br/>instead of getting lost<br/><br/>sure, there is some truth to me<br/>there is some noise around<br/>messing up my hopes<br/>and anything I've found<br/><br/>is, there some meaning to you<br/>some meaning to your lies<br/>and how they blow up my heart<br/>up in a thousand butterflies?<br/><br/>Here now holding my dust<br/>I blow it in the air<br/>so that time and rust<br/>may shake off this despair.
