Who turned off the heating?<br/>Who opened the window?<br/>What's this scorching light<br/>that sears my yawning eyes?<br/>Is it the sort of sun<br/>that dries the butterflies?<br/>Once the sweat has dried<br/>the muscles of the faded<br/>wasted once more in lifting ice,<br/>once the sun has melted<br/>all values that were left black ink on face;<br/>washed you down once more to purity<br/>and in its flowing fury molten over me<br/>risen back to awareness<br/>or the closest I could be.<br/>Who scattered these shapes<br/>in front of me to rearrange?<br/>Who did ever say<br/>that what's to stay will never change?<br/>O my mellow strength build up once more<br/>make me bend and twist my voice,<br/>fill its tone and fall its pitch,<br/>time has come at a cascade<br/>and roars its crave for a brutal snatch<br/>time has come at a cascade<br/>awaiting patient for one more choice.
