Now close your eyes and look at me<br/>the shadows will suffice<br/>I'll hate how light reveals my edges<br/>messing them up on your face<br/><br/>I wish I where a ghost sometimes<br/>or maybe just I had fewer lines<br/>I hate the matter that makes me up<br/>I hate how water never fills the cup<br/><br/>there's so many things I love<br/>yet so little I can touch<br/>as if some pointless daemon<br/>had put me just beyond my reach<br/><br/>if I'm cruel and I'm mean<br/>try annoying me with a stick<br/>I will either suddenly realize <br/>or just hit you with a brick.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
