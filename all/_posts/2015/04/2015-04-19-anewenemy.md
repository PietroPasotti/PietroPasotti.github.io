Now I see you<br/>what was that?<br/>Swirling colours in the foreground<br/>I'm going to miss my hometown<br/><br/>put my head back on my shoulders<br/>lay my arms along my legs<br/>watch the neighbours come and go<br/>flocking by like flying pigs<br/><br/>I filled my house with powder kegs<br/>I'm now ready to show the world who I am<br/>I'm ready to show to myself what I can<br/><br/>no longer for rain my prayers will beg<br/>now I see you are not a friend any more<br/>brighter than anything I had seen before.
