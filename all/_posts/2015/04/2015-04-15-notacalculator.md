I'm not a calculator<br/>I'm done with scintillating<br/>your pattern has come to annoy me<br/>it crossed long ago<br/>the messy line of boredom<br/><br/>I'm fed up<br/>I'm burned out<br/><br/>many layers of green<br/>and colours never seen<br/>cheer up my return to madness<br/>and are likewise<br/>distorted by the wind.<br/><br/>No excuse to my clumsiness<br/>your faces lie there<br/>all around me<br/>perpetual arousal<br/>of the precious shames I couldn't commit<br/><br/>and will stay forever<br/>permanent marks on the skin of the beast<br/>to remind me of their beautiful stories<br/>from the most, to the least.
