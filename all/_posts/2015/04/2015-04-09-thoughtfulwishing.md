Are you waiting for me?<br/>Wait a sec, don't reply<br/>just stand by and see<br/><br/>what if I told you<br/>I've been waiting for you?<br/><br/>I don't know where we could go<br/>not sure what we would do<br/>I've been staring at your window<br/>and I suspect you have been too<br/><br/>I've been thinking of your name<br/>way more than anyone should<br/>I've been wondering all over<br/>if your nails have a good flavour<br/><br/>and a playful parrot queen<br/>has told me you too have been.<br/><br/>We should meet in mid air<br/>floating like weightless clouds<br/>if only life were fair<br/>you wouldn't have no doubts<br/><br/>I've been waking the night through<br/>thinking about you<br/>if only life were fair<br/>I could think you have been too.
