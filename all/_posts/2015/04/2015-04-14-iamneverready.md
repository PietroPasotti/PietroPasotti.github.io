You told me you've flown on<br/>you told me now you're better off<br/>you told me you wouldn't go back<br/>and you're so happy, without me<br/><br/>who is going to wipe my memories off<br/>the tears that have built up<br/>who is going to have me<br/>make sense of your wounded scream<br/>your trembling body<br/>out of control<br/><br/>ten days of tears<br/>of the most heartfelt goodbyes<br/>that was for you<br/>that was for you.<br/><br/>Slowly I walk<br/>I need to make sense<br/>I need to understand<br/>have a feeling,<br/>intense<br/>I need to know who I am<br/>what I am<br/><br/>motionless I stood<br/>in front of you<br/>in spite of you<br/>my spirit had escaped<br/>now I know where it was<br/><br/>my fears have exploded<br/>and I suspect I know the cause<br/>you were about to break free<br/>and I not ready to unleash<br/>I'm never ready<br/><br/>my little sister<br/>my younger daughter<br/>my dearest girl<br/>you had grown up<br/>it was definitely time for a walk.
