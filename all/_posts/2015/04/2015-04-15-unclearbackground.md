Shapes against an unclear background<br/>shades of dark matter explode with a heavy sound<br/>lowly humming in the red starlight<br/>searching open windows<br/>and among the wrongs, my rights.<br/><br/>A promise to a father was broken long ago<br/>daemons threatening to slay me-<br/>what are you waiting for<br/><br/>I'm an intruder shadow on a marble sundial<br/>has it ever come before? Time will come no more<br/>no excuse can be woven around the heart of a desire<br/>and no hope is to be trusted;<br/>that's the way I wash ashore.<br/><br/>Bound to a new Earth<br/>so many beauties to overturn<br/>awaiting the sunburst even though I cannot burn<br/>I'm more and more pleased by an idea of peace<br/>facing the bliss has never been an option to me<br/>may this hatred, with longing, return.
