Anxiety builds up<br/>not yet caught into the vortex<br/>stroking the edge again<br/>a gentle murder of the hopes I had<br/><br/>moved by waves of world-changing energy<br/>struck and altered by an invisible enemy<br/>touching the edge again<br/>less gently, but with a dream in mind<br/><br/>builds up longing like an all-seeing eye<br/>initially climbing on my grudge and<br/>finally knocking on the edge<br/>where probably asleep you already lie.
