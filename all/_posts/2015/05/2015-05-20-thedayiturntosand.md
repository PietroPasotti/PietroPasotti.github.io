Faster than I flow<br/>now shielded by a greater silence<br/>maddened by obsolete prayers<br/>drifted such a long way<br/>they respond no more<br/>to their masters<br/><br/>a blooming tree in a foreign land<br/>struck by lightning where I stand<br/>my lonely garden has no door<br/>all I can do is light the moor<br/><br/>I'll blow your mind<br/>with amazing flowers<br/>blow you up right where you stand<br/>and when I'll take your dead-like hand<br/>I'll look at you<br/>and turn to sand.
