Time to stop<br/>counting some numbers<br/>writing them down<br/>time to consider<br/>what happened to me.<br/><br/>Emotions flow in messy flocks<br/>then tidied up in ticking clocks<br/>await for reading and sympathy<br/>like ancient books in a library.<br/><br/>Surreal and fictitious<br/>elated and here for us<br/><br/>I wanna hear you do anything<br/>to us<br/>sit back and dip in vain lust <br/>watch you cross without a second thought<br/>the thin golden line<br/>telling love from hyrony<br/>I'll stare you quench your heart in mine.<br/><br/>Be patient - one day<br/>I'll say I know you<br/>I'll say I feel like I know what I am<br/>right now I'm lost like a little child<br/>who are you?<br/>Wonder<br/>I vanish inside your desire<br/>dive in your astounding beauty<br/>my hands are full<br/>but I want more<br/>with this frustrating ripeness<br/>I adore.
