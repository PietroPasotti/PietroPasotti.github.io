Aww,<br/>now I see where that fits<br/>there's so many tiny bits<br/>I'll wrap you up in a coherent picture<br/>I'll square you 'round<br/>'til there's no more fracture<br/>I vowed to make sense of things<br/>so now I will make sense of you<br/>I'll get a grasp over your slender form<br/>see to it<br/>that you fit<br/>precisely where you're torn.<br/><br/>Ooo,<br/>amaze and bewilderment<br/>my arts seem useless here<br/>I'm not a freely flowing fluid, I'm afraid<br/>I'm more of a wooden plank<br/>carve me out to some mermaid<br/>sort me out and fill my blank.<br/><br/>Aww,<br/>now I see where this is going<br/>be my guest in this amazing show<br/>(no opaque object on its own can glow)<br/>place me on your shelves<br/>dispose freely of my many selves<br/>be polite and state your mysteries<br/>be kind and ready for the overflow.
