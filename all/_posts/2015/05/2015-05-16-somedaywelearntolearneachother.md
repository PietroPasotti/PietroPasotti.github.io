You must be used to some rude folks, lady<br/>you must have seen some roughing up, beauty<br/>your chisel hands will search my bones<br/>their expertise at carving thrones<br/>will thrill my skin with unusual pleasure<br/>and I'll treat yours with equal measure<br/><br/>but I'm not a monster<br/>(to a person at a time)<br/>so don't give me no violence<br/>and don't ask me for mine<br/><br/>peculiar hybrid of young and old<br/>a walking sin of heat and cold<br/>I learn fast and unlearn slow<br/>you'll push me high, I'll pull you low<br/><br/>some day we learn to learn each other<br/>and after that will come another.<br/><br/><i>(To Helena.)</i>
