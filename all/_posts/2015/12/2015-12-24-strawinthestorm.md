&nbsp;Where are you now?<br/>&nbsp;The counterpoint of my lowest lows<br/>&nbsp;overseeing my ebbs and flows<br/>&nbsp;your reassuring face<br/>&nbsp;full of love and love untold<br/>&nbsp;touches gently as I unfold -<br/>&nbsp;so crisp and crushed<br/>&nbsp;cowering helpless amidst a tremendous tide<br/>&nbsp;my planks and bones shiver uncontrollably<br/>&nbsp;lifted and tilted like a straw in the storm<br/>&nbsp;I've done my best<br/>&nbsp;not to make me any wronger<br/>&nbsp;weave me into your nest<br/>&nbsp;one day I will be stronger -<br/>&nbsp;so go thoughts in storms and droughts,<br/>&nbsp;reminds me of a madman...<br/><br/>&nbsp;A light in the stars<br/>&nbsp;a relief in the scars<br/>&nbsp;rest assured,<br/>&nbsp;this journey will take but a moment<br/>&nbsp;all we do is close our eyes<br/>&nbsp;all it takes is face our wounds.<br/><br/>&nbsp;Where are you now?<br/>&nbsp;Bright as a lighthouse<br/>&nbsp;yet your eyes skim them foamy seaheads<br/>&nbsp;and I am here<br/>&nbsp;so far away<br/>&nbsp;just another day on Earth.
