If the world were a better place, and people were less scared of voicing their true thoughts, I have little doubt &nbsp;``She is a wondrous woman'' would be the most frequently pronounced sentence on Earth. We've known each other for so long as my mind can think, which is pretty long indeed. On the day we first met she gave me a sextant of copper and zinc,<br/>which I learnt to use in speed.<br/><br/>We lived two miles away, which is nowhere close enough, and in a somewhat clear-sky night when my thoughts would go astray<br/>I would take it off its case<br/>and those words begin to say.<br/><br/>with thoughtful lust and bitter care<br/>I'd light a candle and find my way<br/>through shiny sights such longing stare<br/>like a nightly owl the brass will sway<br/><br/>I wonder as silent as silence can be<br/>nowhere close, but not too far<br/>when I finally can see<br/>through the looking brass a star.<br/><br/>The most luminous of all<br/>nowhere close, but not that far;<br/>the pranks light pulls on little men<br/>who fear at night the moon may fall.<br/><br/>At that point She may look my way, not daring to hide a hint of joy<br/>and think about the nightly sky and tell herself ``they're stars, aren't they''.<br/>I'd blow my candle on the spot, and she would smile, as no: they're not.<br/><br/><i>To Helen.</i>
