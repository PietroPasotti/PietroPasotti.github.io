Here it grows<br/>out of proportion<br/>and it swallows whole<br/>even its own distortion<br/><br/>here it grows<br/>here it blows<br/>like a raging river<br/><br/>that no longer flows.<br/><br/>Now I am left behind<br/>facing the chances<br/>of such an obscure time<br/><br/>an eclipse of reason<br/>scattering leashes of death.
