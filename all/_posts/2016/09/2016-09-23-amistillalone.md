Am I still alone?<br/>How can it be?<br/>I thought I was protected<br/>untouched, and unaffected<br/>I took so much pleasure<br/>in my countermeasure<br/>the cure so much sweeter<br/>than the health it respected<br/><br/>it is a drug;<br/>now I know, now I see<br/>now I wrap my head in arms<br/>and warm it back to movement<br/><br/>this is a perfect moment<br/>a moment where I clearly see<br/>what I'd be if I really were<br/>the boy who I should be.
