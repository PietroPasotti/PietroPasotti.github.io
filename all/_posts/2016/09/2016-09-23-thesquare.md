Nobody can walk<br/>inside this little square<br/>ephemerous<br/>yet untouchable and fragile<br/>monstruous<br/>and precious<br/>but only for those who care<br/><br/>not many people<br/>care any more<br/>a handful of others<br/>carries this square<br/><br/>stronger<br/>because a piece of us<br/>cannot be seen<br/>angry<br/>as we were cornered here<br/>and all has been<br/>but nothing could stop you<br/><br/>as you were killing space<br/>- how could you dare -<br/>leaving us only this square.
