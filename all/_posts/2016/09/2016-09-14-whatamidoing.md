I'm sure I'm up to something<br/>not sex, not dream, not food<br/>so it can't be something good<br/><br/>the point is as I often do<br/>I don't know what I'm up to<br/>you'd suspect I secretly know<br/>but in fact I have no clue.<br/><br/>So now get down to me<br/>on your knees<br/>to my knees<br/><br/>we're both leaning<br/>over the same ground<br/>and crying to the same<br/>sound<br/><br/>yet the love you feel<br/>shines a different light<br/>than mine<br/>in fact most of the time<br/>I can't even seem to see it<br/>shine.
