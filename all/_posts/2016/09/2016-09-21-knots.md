Knotting up my fingers<br/>a braid of flesh and bone<br/>I'm drying up too much<br/>I'm slowly turned to stone.<br/><br/>I'm taking my place<br/>on that wooden shelf<br/>nearby the wall<br/>one day I will fall<br/>and become part of the floor.<br/><br/>I'm hiding in the shadow<br/>beneath the stones<br/>with the vermin and the mud<br/>and there's nothing wrong<br/>if that's where I belong,<br/><br/>but what if I do not<br/>what about the knot<br/>that's choking on my fingers<br/>and making me feel broken<br/><br/>has the day already come<br/>have I already fallen<br/>is there anybody hiding<br/>along with me under the rug<br/>into the mud<br/>still shining.
