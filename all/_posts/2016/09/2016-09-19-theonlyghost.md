Noted. White on black<br/>now I know you<br/>back to back<br/>we've been standing<br/>I've been calling<br/>yet your name elusive<br/>calls me from the corners<br/>like a thought but more obtrusive<br/>tickles on my corneas<br/>none of this I wanted<br/>none of that I really need<br/>the truth is this place is haunted<br/>and the only ghost is me.
