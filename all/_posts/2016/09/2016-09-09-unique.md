Every time it's so special<br/>a thousand shades of unique<br/>or is it the secret<br/>of all that mystique?<br/><br/>I am but a piece of cloth<br/>in the storm<br/>a single feather<br/>or little more than a few bones<br/>wrapped up around in leather<br/><br/>the many times I've tried<br/>to teach myself some manners<br/>the many times they did<br/>it didn't last forever<br/><br/>now as coarse as a wolf hide<br/>search a place for a long sleep<br/>I'm hybernating deep, this time<br/>there will be no mistakes tonight<br/><br/>I'll wake up in the winter<br/>I know<br/>when all is cold for real<br/>and hidden by the snow.
