Not enough papercuts<br/>to keep me busy<br/>to keep me walking<br/>it won't be easy<br/>to keep looking around<br/>am I lost or am I found<br/>I keel reaching for the same old things<br/>falling as I have no wings<br/><br/>tell me how to make it<br/>or I will give up and die<br/>for I have little else to lose.
