Not many fragments have made it this far<br/>shallower, deeper, they all left a scar<br/>no wonder all the stories<br/>we tell ourselves at night<br/>fail to take us any further<br/>or are we already really far<br/><br/>sentence upon sentence<br/>you describe yourself to me<br/>is there something you can't tell<br/>and if you can why cannot we<br/>do the same and spell out loud<br/>what we are or cannot be<br/><br/>not wandering any further<br/>no waiting any longer<br/>put those pieces back in place<br/>drawing outlines of my face.
