Voltage: low;<br/>speed: quite slow;<br/>energy: falling;<br/>eyes: brown;<br/>species: clown -<br/>not a laugh, not a move<br/>will crash through me<br/>as it's supposed to do.<br/><br/>Today I am quite motionless and passive<br/>a lonely heart depressive<br/>today I press my thumbs together<br/>in a most intimate kind of kiss<br/>and that is all I'll get today.
