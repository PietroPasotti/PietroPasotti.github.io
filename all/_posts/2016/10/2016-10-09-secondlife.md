I need to live a second life<br/>as if one were not enough<br/>another me, unlike me, unsafe<br/>not so much scared of sleeping rough<br/>not so much thoughtful<br/>and regretful<br/>I mean, a bit more tough.<br/><br/>I need to live another time<br/>every day, from start to end<br/>a day in which I'd find a friend<br/>I'd have it all, or at least some<br/>I'd be much shorter, and have a gun<br/>I'd be less silent, I would have fun<br/><br/>People would come and talk to us<br/>eat from our hands, like grateful pigeons<br/>they would see me and who I am<br/>and they will stop me if they can,<br/><br/>And they will ask me, what have I done<br/>I'll say: two lives? Not even one.
