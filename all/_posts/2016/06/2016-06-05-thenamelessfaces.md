Fallen in the line of duty<br/>fallen on my quest for beauty<br/>as the glimpses that I get<br/>I most rapidly forget<br/><br/>climbing on to the next cutie<br/>no meaning yet but a nameless craving<br/>praving the silence for a thunderous loving<br/>as the eyes I follow have no name<br/>there's no winning in this game<br/>it's a show of life and death alike<br/>anything else would come out fake<br/>it's already lost a game<br/>and I too have lost my name.
