<meta name="description" content="Would I feel like a sort of worm,if what we built over ancient chaos,because of me and my fool actions,was torn apart cause I wrong behave?All the things I used to say,would be all crazy to rely,cause I think that my emotionsare mad as the one who embody,to the angels I thought I love,to the white-winged daemons I thought I follow,to the people I wanted and’s never been,I bow, I bow goodbye. Goodbye.Could I be the best one ever,could you be the first and last,could it be the only fable,and what if we end up lost?I’d love to be who maybe I’m not,but I’ll try I swear to make good things,and everything will seem so sweet,we’ll have to force our way to grave,and what if there won’t be need,and what if we really are,and what if we wanna be,each other’s one and only love?To the angels I thought I love,to the white-winged daemons I thought I follow,to the people I wanted and’s never been,I bow, I bow goodbye. Goodbye.Sometimes emotions aren’t so simple,but if we’re strong and I am not,but if we’re together and we will be,we’ll all be happy or we’ll see.I wanna live to see this ending,I wanna look and stay up watching,I wanna feel and give you slicesof my own heart just full of ashes,I wanna let you take my best parts,I wanna try the trees to wind,I wanna force my way to heaven,and we’ll all see how it’s to do.To the angels I thought I love,to the white-winged daemons I thought I follow,to the people I wanted and’s never beenI bow, I bow goodbye. Goodbye.Now goodbye I hope so far,cause we trade our hearts, and I owe her mine,cause I feel like mine has been so lone,I tried with you but we won’t be,I tried to be your best friend ever,but we threw our arms in wrong directions,maybe we’d loved or we will do,maybe I am to fly with you.Maybe we were or we will be,the couple of friends no one has seen,the mates of ever and the never,the dragons firing a world of doom,maybe I love you and maybe I don’t,we’ll never know but time will show,as my new breeze is overcoming,and I won’t be any longer waiting,all I wanted was more of you,and if the world will be seen greener,we’ll all be caused by your lovely kisses,or we’ll all be far from life.To the angels I thought I love,to the white-winged daemons I thought I follow,to the people I wanted and’s never beenI bow, I bow goodbye. Goodbye.But in the end the peace I show,may be greater than the crisis I wanted,and if I’d been to live till now,well I’m proud of you and who loved me,if I had to fight for this heart,well maybe I have done well,well maybe I am to die now,but this will be shown in the night,I know I have failed,I know I’ve missed you much,you know exactly how to face me,and so now please tell me I’m wrong,and if it’s not I’ll burn in shame,and if it is I’ll be so happy,for a day and night the moon will stop,because I know I am so weak.Let this perfect silence fill the sky,let it slip thru every leaf,let it make thru every heart,let it burn thru who lost his one,let this thinking boy leave his world safe,let him place a bomb upon the cruels,let his loved be in peace with fire,and in the end let her be happy.I want this odd song to be read in nights,when you feel more lone and far away,let it lighten your sad days,let it sadden every moment,let it squeeze your heart till tears,cause so many are to be poured,and I think it’s so good thing,I think we should cry every moment,I think a tear with a truthful smile,altogether and not enemies,would be able to crunch every silence,would fetch you the key for happiness.To the angels I thought I love,to the white-winged daemons I thought I follow,to the people I wanted and’s never beenI bow, I bow goodbye. Goodbye.And this song would never end,as there’re too many things to say,but I’m sure you’ll understand,I’ll be there for you to talk,so goodbye maybe only friend,let’s see tomorrow or another day,but make it come as soon as you can,cause alone I’m only me,altogether we are the one,and hand in hand we’ll see the end,or the beginning of something else,we might only ask the moon.We all are pieces of broken puzzles,and it’s so hard to put together,but we have made this and more and more,we’d love to watch the hidden photo,and what if we’ll be watching sun,and what if we’ll stand to ourselves,and what if we’ll see each other,hope will be the most right ever.To the angels I thought I love,to the white-winged daemons I thought I follow,to the people I wanted and’s never beenI bow, I bow goodbye. Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.To Serena, to Anna, to us, to all of us. To everyone." />

Goodbye.<br /><br />Now goodbye I hope so far,<br />cause we trade our hearts, and I owe her mine,<br />cause I feel like mine has been so lone,<br />I tried with you but we won’t be,<br /><br />I tried to be your best friend ever,<br />but we threw our arms in wrong directions,<br />maybe we’d loved or we will do,<br />maybe I am to fly with you.<br /><br />Maybe we were or we will be,<br />the couple of friends no one has seen,<br />the mates of ever and the never,<br />the dragons firing a world of doom,<br /><br />maybe I love you and maybe I don’t,<br />we’ll never know but time will show,<br />as my new breeze is overcoming,<br />and I won’t be any longer waiting,<br /><br />all I wanted was more of you,<br />and if the world will be seen greener,<br />we’ll all be caused by your lovely kisses,<br />or we’ll all be far from life.<br /><br />To the angels I thought I love,<br />to the white-winged daemons I thought I follow,<br />to the people I wanted and’s never been<br />I bow, I bow goodbye. Goodbye.<br /><br />But in the end the peace I show,<br />may be greater than the crisis I wanted,<br />and if I’d been to live till now,<br />well I’m proud of you and who loved me,<br /><br />if I had to fight for this heart,<br />well maybe I have done well,<br />well maybe I am to die now,<br />but this will be shown in the night,<br /><br />I know I have failed,<br />I know I’ve missed you much,<br />you know exactly how to face me,<br />and so now please tell me I’m wrong,<br /><br />and if it’s not I’ll burn in shame,<br />and if it is I’ll be so happy,<br />for a day and night the moon will stop,<br />because I know I am so weak.<br /><br />Let this perfect silence fill the sky,<br />let it slip thru every leaf,<br />let it make thru every heart,<br />let it burn thru who lost his one,<br /><br />let this thinking boy leave his world safe,<br />let him place a bomb upon the cruels,<br />let his loved be in peace with fire,<br />and in the end let her be happy.<br /><br />I want this odd song to be read in nights,<br />when you feel more lone and far away,<br />let it lighten your sad days,<br />let it sadden every moment,<br /><br />let it squeeze your heart till tears,<br />cause so many are to be poured,<br />and I think it’s so good thing,<br />I think we should cry every moment,<br /><br />I think a tear with a truthful smile,<br />altogether and not enemies,<br />would be able to crunch every silence,<br />would fetch you the key for happiness.<br /><br />To the angels I thought I love,<br />to the white-winged daemons I thought I follow,<br />to the people I wanted and’s never been<br />I bow, I bow goodbye. Goodbye.<br /><br />And this song would never end,<br />as there’re too many things to say,<br />but I’m sure you’ll understand,<br />I’ll be there for you to talk,<br /><br />so goodbye maybe only friend,<br />let’s see tomorrow or another day,<br />but make it come as soon as you can,<br />cause alone I’m only me,<br /><br />altogether we are the one,<br />and hand in hand we’ll see the end,<br />or the beginning of something else,<br />we might only ask the moon.<br /><br />We all are pieces of broken puzzles,<br />and it’s so hard to put together,<br />but we have made this and more and more,<br />we’d love to watch the hidden photo,<br /><br />and what if we’ll be watching sun,<br />and what if we’ll stand to ourselves,<br />and what if we’ll see each other,<br />hope will be the most right ever.<br /><br />To the angels I thought I love,<br />to the white-winged daemons I thought I follow,<br />to the people I wanted and’s never been<br />I bow, I bow goodbye. Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.<br /><br />To Serena, to Anna, to us, to all of us.  To everyone.</p>
