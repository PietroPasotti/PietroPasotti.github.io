['english']
Pride


Oh I toppled the same stone
so many times
over and over
and raging in the cold
stone upon stone
somebody once told me
you can't go there alone
and so I did go there alone
because, you know, 
fuck them.
I go where I want
I dream my mouth wide
and wherever I walk
I step forth with pride.
