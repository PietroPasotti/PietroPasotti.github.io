I see you touching one another<br/>speaking of habit and sympathy<br/>I wish that rain could water me<br/><br/>your eyes may meet at any place<br/>impose on it some shared perfume<br/>and drag along your happy face<br/>for random giggles to consume<br/><br/>I see you coming a long way<br/>and weaving all your dreams ahead<br/>and candid, there, for all to see<br/><br/>another world of things to say<br/>another dress returning thread<br/>I wish that rain could water me.
