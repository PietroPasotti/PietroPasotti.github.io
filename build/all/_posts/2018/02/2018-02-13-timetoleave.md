Is it time to leave?<br/>The grass' still green<br/>the weather's calm<br/>the foxes feed<br/>off someone else's herd<br/>sure there's a wolf<br/>but a wolf's no bird<br/>he cannot run where we can hide<br/>we get our rest, our sun, our shade<br/>but is it time to leave?<br/>The winter's gone<br/>even the nightmares<br/>have a few smiles to spare<br/>a choice has to be taken -<br/>to rest in peace or dare.
