Little letters, crazy thoughts<br/>no symbols for my heart<br/>yet words behind my eyes<br/>doors bashed down<br/>into some sort of reality<br/>who is it - who speaks to me?<br/>Rambling colours and all -<br/>bunnies, squares, no solitude<br/>there's no silence for my ears<br/>no symbols for my heart.<br/>Like a code I need to crack<br/>that's my heart talking to me<br/>I hope it should explain itself<br/>but all it says is -<br/>wait and see.
