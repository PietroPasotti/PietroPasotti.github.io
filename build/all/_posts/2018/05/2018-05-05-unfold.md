I don't feel like doing much<br/>except maybe unfolding lives<br/>as if hoping that by accident<br/>I will thus be unfolding mine<br/><br/>it doesn't feel like anything<br/>or maybe it cannot be felt:<br/>we're not ready to be told<br/>and it's really not our fault<br/><br/>unlit by sudden darkness<br/>upon our faces slam the blinds<br/>untold by a hungry silence<br/>the story swallows back our minds<br/><br/>unraveled beauty torturing our days<br/>as patiently we wait<br/>for something we can touch<br/>but it's so tiring being a bait,<br/><br/>and I don't feel like doing much.
