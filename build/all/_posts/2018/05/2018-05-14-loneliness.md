Some people live their loneliness<br/>as it were a passing wind<br/>cuddling in the shade<br/>with the heavy ghosts who couldn't fly<br/>away<br/><br/>some people live their loneliness<br/>as it were a simple matter<br/>but mine is a flood barrier<br/>ready<br/>ready to shatter<br/><br/>every day I am alone<br/>is a day alone I feel<br/>and every day so passing by<br/>is impossible to fill<br/>at all.
