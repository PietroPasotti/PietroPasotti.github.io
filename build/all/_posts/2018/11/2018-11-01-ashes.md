No hope be put on hold<br/>ashed onto my name<br/>beautiful fires for starry nights<br/>evoqued by a dance<br/>whose moves run in my veins<br/><br/>spectres of the fallen trees<br/>echo along the mountain cliffs<br/>run up through the canyons<br/>explode towards the sky<br/><br/>a knot within a knot<br/>a feeling in my heart<br/>unfamiliar faces<br/>looking down to earth<br/>ready to smile or burn in anger<br/>with the same arrogant ease.
