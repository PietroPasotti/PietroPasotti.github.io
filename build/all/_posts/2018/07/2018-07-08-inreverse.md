Oh that's it<br/>we're in reverse<br/>listen to the wind<br/>blasting through the branches<br/>splitting their souls open<br/>with surgical speed<br/>and we rattle along<br/>unique melody<br/>rolling in the grass<br/>just you just me<br/><br/>another gust another flip<br/>and crackling like a whip<br/>the tree decides above our eyes<br/>to hum a bit more deep<br/><br/>and the words the smelly leaves<br/>the warmth at last of a forgiving sun<br/>chooses not to run<br/>but linger about for as long as it can<br/><br/>how grateful I am, thank you<br/>thank me, echoes the wind<br/>all in reverse, where have we been<br/>and how on earth did we come to.<br/><br/><em>To Natalia...</em>
