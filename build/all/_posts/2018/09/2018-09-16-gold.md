It's actually gold<br/>shining in your eyes<br/>a nugget on a stand<br/>another in your hand<br/>but not really looking<br/>breathing up and shaking<br/>talking to yourself<br/>or maybe someone else,<br/>I don't know anymore<br/>too many echoes<br/>fly around my shoulders<br/>to tell whose line is yours.<br/>And none of us is rich of nothing<br/>we claim to be satisfied<br/>but where is the quiet peace of mind<br/>we thought we had moments ago?
