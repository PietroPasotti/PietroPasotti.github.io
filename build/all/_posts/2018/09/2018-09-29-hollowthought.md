The days I spent in hollow thought<br/>they won't abide by no regret<br/>and I'm not trying to forget<br/>as that's a war that can't be fought<br/><br/>I wish I could be spent<br/>like a night on a beach<br/>with friends and a fire<br/><br/>I wish I could consume<br/>like time does on my skin<br/>indulge my little game;<br/><br/>the nights I spent in hollow thought<br/>are the nights I cannot waste<br/>stuck on my tongue the taste<br/>of a dream that can't be caught.
