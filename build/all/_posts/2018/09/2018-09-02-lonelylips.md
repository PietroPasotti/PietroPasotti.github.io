I get the feeling<br/>when nothing comes easy<br/>solid ground gets sticky<br/>the air is just too dense<br/>to be chewed by lonely lips<br/>I get it, I really do<br/>if a lonely lip am I<br/>a lonely lip are you<br/>may we meet halfway<br/>like we belong to the same face<br/>and find something sweet to say<br/>in one of our strange ways.
