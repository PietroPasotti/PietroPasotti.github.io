It's just my body and my voice<br/>against the paradox of choice<br/>I'd kiss you many times again<br/>I'm a creature of simple pleasures<br/>and not only for your eyes<br/>I'm a man of hidden treasures<br/><br/>so how do we choose what trees to climb<br/>give the low-hanging fruit<br/>the attention they deserve<br/>but not a minute more<br/>lest passion become chore.
