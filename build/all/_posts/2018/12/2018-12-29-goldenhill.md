<br/>No need to be alone<br/>there's a place for you and me<br/>just atop that golden hill<br/>there's a house in a windmill<br/>gentle breezes all year round<br/>a river's charming humming sound<br/>and rocks to climb and willow trees<br/>and many flowers full of bees<br/>and one thing left to make it true:<br/>a lovely loving you.<br/><br/><i> To Odilia... </i>
