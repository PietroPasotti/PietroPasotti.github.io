Sometimes I don't get<br/>the way worlds grow<br/>one upon another<br/>and talk through barren spaces<br/>where one word out of two<br/>gets squeezed between the planets<br/><br/>and woven in warm blankets<br/>their words swell up with sunlight<br/>and gliding aimlessly<br/>they sail towards a distant star.
