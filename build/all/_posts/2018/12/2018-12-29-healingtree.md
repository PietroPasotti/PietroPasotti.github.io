To you who can climb mountains<br/>I give a healing tree<br/>so may the wind up there on top<br/>fill your lungs and make you free<br/><br/>to you who can climb mountains<br/>I give a living plant<br/>a green dot in a desert<br/>for those who said you can't<br/><br/>be what you like to<br/>bloom like a tree<br/>do what you love<br/>or simply be free.<br/><br/><i> To Kenza... </i>
