Another song for rain<br/>as rain's already here<br/>I'm swimming, drenched,<br/>and blissful, quenched<br/>the thirst is gone<br/>but not the laugh<br/>at last I feel I have<br/>enough<br/>then do we sing for rain?<br/>We do!<br/>A prayer not for wishes<br/>to hid us from the madness<br/>when the times are dire --<br/>but one for burning lashes<br/>to please the god of sadness<br/>for turning ice to fire.
