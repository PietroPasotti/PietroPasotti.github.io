What is it about the<br/>cuts around one's body<br/>what is it about those lines<br/>that set apart and join<br/>that tear, that seam<br/>and sever still<br/>conceal, enhance<br/>that stare and glance<br/>those lines<br/>tight around the body<br/>a calligraphy of thread<br/>talking to me<br/>ungrammatically.<br/>Yet it all makes sense<br/>these faults which swallow mountains<br/>horisons beyond which<br/>all light becomes some noise<br/>and all effects their cause.
