The night has fallen<br/>yet something lingers on<br/>a smell of bread being baked<br/>a chirping from the trees<br/>a green like the first leaves<br/><br/>and all objects throw around<br/>their shades in a different way<br/>-- I know what you would say --<br/>a falling night should make no sound,<br/><br/>a falling night can't have a smell<br/>or a colour, except black<br/>and thereby all colour lack<br/>and that's why nights can only fall.
