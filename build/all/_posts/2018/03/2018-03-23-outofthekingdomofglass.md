And I am locked out, at last<br/>out of my kingdom of glass --<br/>and there's so much light out here<br/>that all we can see<br/>is a prison of mirrors<br/><br/>but maybe that's it<br/>does it matter? I'm out<br/>I'm out<br/>no more glasses around me<br/>no more glasses in my body<br/>no more glasses on the ground<br/>I can walk without no fear<br/>barefoot in the grass<br/><br/>there is one constant heartbeat<br/>one that I've been chasing<br/>in and out of invisible doors<br/>the silver thread which sews my limbs<br/>a thread which silently still spins<br/>the many cobwebs in my heart.
