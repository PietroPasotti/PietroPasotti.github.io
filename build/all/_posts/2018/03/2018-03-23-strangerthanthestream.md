Slow and subtle<br/>upon your chest<br/>write my love in a pale ink<br/>lighter than I think<br/>is my shiver down your<br/>neck, stronger than I know<br/>has my hand been choking yours.<br/><br/>It's no man's fault<br/>the way the sky is written in between the stars<br/>or the thoughts I tie around your ankles<br/>those knots you're not supposed to know<br/><br/>but you do<br/>and you read me back<br/>straight through the cipher<br/>across the words I dare not write<br/>as if you found an island<br/>still made of water<br/>but stronger than the stream.
