A terrified shape<br/>bolts through the woods<br/>shaking my trees<br/>burying my bones<br/>will you find me <br/>later, when you need<br/>the time to feel at home<br/>but who knows where my home is.<br/><br/>How do we get along<br/>the time to talk<br/>and be together<br/>flips like a switch<br/>and on and off<br/>but there's no light within.<br/><br/>We look for one another<br/>but the room is empty<br/>where have we all gone?<br/><br/>Suddenly<br/>breathing onto mirrors again<br/>searching for a ghost<br/>a trace we didn't draw<br/>a line that's yet to cross.<br/><br/>You scared me<br/>and where am I now?<br/>Safe and alone<br/>safe and alone.
