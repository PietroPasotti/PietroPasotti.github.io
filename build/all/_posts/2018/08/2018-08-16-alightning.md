I am a lightning<br/>stuck between the trees<br/>chopping trunks and branches<br/>ravaging the leaves<br/><br/>there is no depth within me<br/>lashing like a living whip<br/>a fallen lizard tail<br/>restless in its sleep<br/><br/>I'm looking for the might<br/>to crush everything I touch,<br/>there is no strength within me<br/>every small thing is too much<br/><br/>and here I am a lightning<br/>chaotic with despair<br/>and yet I won't stop fighting<br/>against the thinning air.
