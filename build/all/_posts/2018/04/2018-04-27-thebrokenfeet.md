And there it was;<br/>balled up, all hedge-hogged<br/>like chewed and then discarded<br/>because it wasn't good enough<br/><br/>and we weren't ashamed of losing it<br/>it was a fair price to be paid<br/>for how beautiful it was<br/>in every smallest shade;<br/><br/>but then tainted it looks up<br/>and I see its hollow eyes<br/>and follow all the way<br/>down until its broken feet;<br/><br/>we weren't afraid of letting it go<br/>we said, it was a fair price to pay<br/>and we'd do it all over again<br/>and we'd love all the same way,<br/>we say.
