And I used to swim in complexity<br/>until I realised it was drowning me<br/><br/>Now I'm a simple man<br/>easy going<br/>easily gone<br/>easily made<br/>and undone<br/>I have simple dreams<br/>still hard enough to grasp<br/>and attain<br/><br/>so much they've grown<br/>filling all available space<br/>learned to walk, to run, to race<br/>so much they have been shown<br/><br/>they're now addicted to life<br/>but one they never had<br/>and they crave with desperate screams<br/>for even my dreams have dreams.
