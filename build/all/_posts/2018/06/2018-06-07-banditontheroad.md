A bandit craving asphalt<br/>the wind that sweeps the street<br/>a caravel of thoughts<br/>preparing to overtake<br/><br/>softening the edges<br/>of a gasping afternoon<br/>dulling reality<br/>with a whiff of cartoon<br/><br/>we often see it moving backwards<br/>and standing up again<br/>a bandit craving asphalt<br/>but asphalt won't sustain.
