I do as if it didn't touch me<br/>but it touched me all right<br/>I talk as if it didn't matter<br/>but things are in my hands<br/>and my fingers made it so.<br/>A cover on a cover<br/>but nothing to be read<br/>we talk and we don't talk<br/>we hide and show<br/>opaque we glow<br/>yet we never get close<br/>enough.<br/>We're lazily caught<br/>in one another's gravity<br/>we follow the wake<br/>learning as we go<br/>we're making it so hard<br/>to take it<br/>take it slow.<br/><br/><i>To Eveline...</i>
