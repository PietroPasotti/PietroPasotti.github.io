Will you<br/>be here<br/>when the rain starts hitting<br/>and the drops fall smelting<br/>my face with the pale mask of silver<br/>that will hide it forever<br/>from the eyes of the mortals<br/>and the hands of the weak.<br/><br/>Maybe the time has come<br/>when I fade and become<br/>another spot<br/>on the hidden face of the moon.<br/><br/>We're stained and stain<br/>like a sickness spreads<br/>but we spiders thread<br/>one leg closer<br/>one jump further<br/>hoping that one day<br/>we could climb still alive<br/>to the hidden face of the moon.<br/><br/>Will you<br/>be there<br/>when the silent mountains where there is no snow<br/>where the dust is stone and there is no air<br/>will become a shelter for all of our despair.
