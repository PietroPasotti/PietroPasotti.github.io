Look at me, you strange delight<br/>you crazy angel, you secret light<br/>you hid away in front of me<br/>you saw me blind but I can see<br/><br/>You crazy star, my mon amour,<br/>my lonely sun my solitude<br/>the days go fast and shadows bend<br/>except on you, this is the end.<br/><br/>I turn to stone from flesh and bone<br/>until I know that you're no more<br/>it has been long since the sunrise<br/>she said welcome, to paradise.<br/><br/>I seek exactly what you seek<br/>but in a language you can't speak<br/>I know precisely where you are<br/>I look precisely where you stare<br/><br/>you can't be forever mine<br/>wherever ends, it will be fine<br/>and you my angel in disguise<br/>you said welcome, to paradise.<br/><br/>A tricky sun befell on me<br/>a strange prelude of tragedy<br/>I turned my head to notre amour<br/>ripping the sun off its contour<br/><br/>my dreams are there for you to harm<br/>I trade my hope for your crazy charm<br/>has been too long since the sunrise<br/>you're here again,<br/>you say welcome<br/>to paradise.
