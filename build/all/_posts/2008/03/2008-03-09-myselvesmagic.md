Feats of magic,<br/>light of tragic,<br/>rescue me and bring<br/>to sky, forge a ring<br/>for mage to move and kill,<br/>create a dragon and a hill,<br/>to move around the monsters,<br/>hide inside heart-climbers,<br/>hide inside dream-drilling happy<br/>unhearing players, puppets of me.<br/><br/>Witches and mages,<br/>jinxes and elements,<br/>are you friends<br/>or darkest fiends?<br/><br/>I'd love to know myselves<br/>as deep as my unconsciousness,<br/>never been so less<br/>powerful to separe the halves.<br/><br/>Control isn't enough,<br/>never been so tough<br/>to pick up sword,<br/>so must fight with word.
