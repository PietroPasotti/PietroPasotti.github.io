Speaking with<br/>who I cannot manage to<br/>forget, I often seem instead<br/>ignoring world's width,<br/>and loving it more too,<br/>what's up in my head?<br/><br/>Thru an iron cable<br/>it seems I am<br/>not at all able<br/>to realize that I can<br/><br/>not forget it all and turn away<br/>and I even hope when<br/>I'm away and just begin<br/>to look at nature in new reign<br/>and not even then,<br/>it gets to me I'm lost today.<br/><br/>And forever on.<br/><br/>What if the match I cannot win<br/>turns out have never begin<br/>and I get to heart finally<br/>that I cannot as wished fly?<br/><br/>Please.
