It's a raindrop in the end<br/>when rainbow is still up<br/>but gonna fall under land,<br/><br/>stuck on a greener leaf top<br/>growing up in wild and sand<br/>and still living and yup,<br/><br/>is going to thrive.<br/><br/>It knows it's to last bend<br/>and fears both fallin', waitin'<br/>for sun to drain, and no mend<br/><br/>it's forever, just an instant for deciding,<br/>and turning. What will do, no wand,<br/>no way to escape or choice to make, raining?<br/><br/>It's over, no more snow,<br/>and clouds so slow<br/>are flowing away in blow<br/>leaving to sun the sky to know,<br/>and I cannot see it glow,<br/>so in deepness my sadness show,<br/>and I'm afraid to see seed grow.
