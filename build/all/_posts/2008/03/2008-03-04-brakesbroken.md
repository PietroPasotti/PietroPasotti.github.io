Minutes, hours and days,<br/>damn years and periods,<br/>waitin' for fishes to bite rods<br/>and, shame, day come and rays<br/><br/>of sun are just now falling.<br/>Eclypse for hope of mine,<br/>wait for it explode in mine<br/>and then get stuck yelling,<br/><br/>no way to escape and fake<br/>myself in saying on that<br/>everything I need's a brake<br/><br/>to pull and save my life.<br/>A last deep breath to take,<br/>and then up to love rife.
