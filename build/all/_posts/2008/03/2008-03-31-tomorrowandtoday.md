I've long been looking for<br/>tomorrow, but now even<br/>that I'm getting the today<br/><br/>I already feel that anyway<br/>won't get somone to believe in<br/>and without you it's the bore.<br/><br/>Cheer in front of bodies,<br/>smile in front of nightmare,<br/>cause only worse can get,<br/><br/>and if it does you won't forget<br/>that you were almost aware<br/>and you'd have had less agonies.<br/><br/>Doves don't burn touching  electricity<br/>and you can't die as I do if happens,<br/>but look at me turning into dust,<br/><br/>who liked you even more than most,<br/>who from the begin to end saddens<br/>and is gonna try to hate felicity.
