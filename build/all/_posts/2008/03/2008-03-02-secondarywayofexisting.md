Oh singer truthbringer<br/>come to show us terror,<br/>come to destiny caller,<br/>show all of us the error<br/><br/>of mindless human beings<br/>who think that curtains<br/>are instruments to freedom,<br/>instead of suicidal liberation.<br/><br/>Explain to the damn stubborn<br/>neverliving and neverborn<br/>that this isn't life,<br/>neither is death, its a middle way of feeling<br/>and sensing<br/>this secondary way of existing.<br/><br/>Passive passion<br/>is not emotion,<br/>is a sad and pale mirror for world's<br/>face,<br/>ache and no brace<br/>can hold it up,<br/>so<br/>seven years, seven unlucky periods<br/>of crying nimrods<br/>and falling doves.<br/><br/>Slam the door,<br/>blow it up, burn and let explode<br/>the rage, pull the page of the<br/>nonsensible life.
