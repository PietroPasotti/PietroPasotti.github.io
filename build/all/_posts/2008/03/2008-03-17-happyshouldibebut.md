A pretty way of sensing you,<br/>I'm not sure of the reaction,<br/>but I hope it's right as good<br/>as I feel it is, so, happy! Should<br/>I be,<br/>but,<br/>I'm not.<br/><br/>I cannot smell satisfaction,<br/>still looking for you,<br/>still asking for myself.<br/><br/>As you know so I am weird,<br/>strange, perhaps friendly,<br/>hope sympathetic, clumsy,<br/>if you wished me disappeared,<br/><br/>here it is the proof we failed,<br/>I failed and I beg, I hope you<br/>forgive, cause you know I tried<br/>every way I could<br/>just to make it through.
