My life is getting slow, I sense<br/>I'm slowing and trying to flatten<br/>every moment that I can catch,<br/>every instant I manage to watch,<br/>every scene I'll want to listen,<br/>again and again, so immense.<br/><br/>A snapshot to remember, missing<br/>present and fearing future,<br/>feeling such a deadly rupture,<br/>try to fix up what you're living.<br/><br/>Will come a day I'll burn all it,<br/>I'll fear the memory of everything<br/>I'll try to forget all of my past,<br/>and even if it's my best and last,<br/>I admit I cannot fit my doing<br/>I'm afraid I'll give the hit.
