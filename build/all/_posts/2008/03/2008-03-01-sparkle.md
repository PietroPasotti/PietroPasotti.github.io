Isn't this the little sparkle,<br/>the bright light that<br/>runs through us<br/>and under eyes wet<br/>shows to thus<br/>who think you're little<br/><br/>that it is a lie,<br/>that you would like to share<br/>your flare, glisten, aware<br/>of other's die.<br/><br/>Flare, thank for passing,<br/>that's so embrassing<br/>but I wanna feel it all<br/>and I dunno what I shall<br/><br/>do and experience,<br/>cause so many essences<br/>are now inside me glances<br/>within violence<br/><br/>of pain I show.
