So you can show who you are,<br/>now don't fear and just reveal,<br/>I can't hurt as much you do.<br/>Don't you feel the end's appeal,<br/>don't you need to see the true,<br/>don't you want to stare at star?<br/><br/>It's just over you in sky,<br/>you could even touch it now,<br/>and you don't. Why do you let<br/>the comet vanish, and show<br/>no pain in fairy rain for that,<br/>which you'll want to forget, shy?<br/><br/>Don't you think you've ever had,<br/>don't you know it has been there,<br/>don't you sense I'm here for you,<br/>are you sure you want trees bare,<br/>are you ready to make it through,<br/>and try not to get like me, so sad?
