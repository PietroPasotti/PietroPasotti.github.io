Could I be blind but still<br/>love you, could I be nothing<br/>but still try to please you till<br/>the end of what I can, hoping<br/><br/>in all but you, and only<br/>in your true. A blood rush<br/>to my head, close eyes to fly,<br/>don't need pockets or even cash,<br/><br/>to please you, so far I hope.<br/>I'm afraid of what I can't know,<br/>as well as inner myselves' shape,<br/><br/>as well as what you don't show,<br/>who I know's the only scape<br/>the only without hoe can grow.
