When I feel something from inner,<br/>should I say or should I render<br/>what I sense somehow isn't better<br/>than you hope, it doesn't matter,<br/>please now really you don't bother,<br/>it's of mine, of mine alore, her<br/>is not who really loves me, crier.<br/><br/>Weaker even more<br/>than I ever felt before<br/>and nearer to seashore<br/>I desire I never wore<br/>the long red dress of sore,<br/>the only thing that me tore<br/>and tears now me apart, war,<br/>dissonance of us the core.<br/><br/>And now it's coming yore,<br/>near not even a healer,<br/>it's just a dead sad singer,<br/>waiting hit looking from fore.
