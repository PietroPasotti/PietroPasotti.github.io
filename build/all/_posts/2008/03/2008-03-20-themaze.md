Where to go and when to turn,<br/>this is easy in your life, but may<br/>be not in the huge maze, in which<br/>I'm getting lost. I cannot switch<br/>on the light, cannot see where I<br/>will go, so hit the wall and learn.<br/><br/>Learn, finally understand<br/>that who is lost in the very end<br/>it's you and not never me,<br/>but where to go I cannot see.<br/><br/>Will I keep on scratching rocky<br/>walls and bruised rocks, will<br/>I force myself to walk till light,<br/>cause this world is cold and tight,<br/>dunno if it's enough my will,<br/>but in the end I'll face the tricky<br/><br/>destiny.<br/>Destiny.
