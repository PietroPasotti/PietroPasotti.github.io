I'm waiting for such great things<br/>from such great beings,<br/>and I know you so deserve,<br/>and you from me reserve,<br/><br/>but I believe in you,<br/>and I think that through<br/>everything you can be,<br/><br/>and live, beside me,<br/>who cannot stand a whisper<br/>cause to reach the sky walljumper<br/>is not enough,<br/>is not enough.<br/><br/>I am, am I, asking us<br/>to get a slice of heart together,<br/>so as to let even me rise,<br/><br/>even if I dunno I'd be better,<br/>but now I beg you wise<br/>to make me lighter,<br/><br/>if we still can. Can we,<br/>I don't know, I don't wanna,<br/>but if you think could be,<br/><br/>and don't you say it's gonna<br/>be better anyway, maybe,<br/>if not even the Nirvana,<br/><br/>it's going to<br/>be harder if you do,<br/>but help<br/>who cannot stand a whisper<br/>cause to reach the sky walljumper<br/>is not enough,<br/>is not enough.<br/><br/>Share an atom of your soul,<br/>to a spare, bare child<br/>who lost himself in howl,<br/><br/>and cannot reveal to wild,<br/>and try to away crawl,<br/>as soon as pain's not mild.<br/><br/>I don't want even to think<br/>how could I have changed all,<br/>made universe seem more pink,<br/><br/>but I missed time for fall<br/>in love, and got the blink,<br/>that worst is getting small.<br/><br/>And I know I am<br/>who cannot stand a whisper<br/>cause to reach the sky walljumper<br/>is not enough,<br/>is not enough.<br/><br/>Today's another one, and<br/>beside the sun here star rises<br/>and beside desert sand and land<br/><br/>here it is a heaven of peaces,<br/>someone to hold a bit my hand,<br/>to glue my breaking pieces.<br/><br/>I'd love you to know you seem<br/>to me, even over glowing sparkle,<br/>that you owe my best esteem,<br/><br/>and that even if I don't twinkle,<br/>somehow you'd been my dream,<br/>if it wasn't steam so hard wrinkle.<br/><br/>And in the and I am again<br/>who cannot stand a whisper<br/>cause to reach the sky walljumper<br/>is not enough,<br/>is not enough.<br/><br/>Going on I understand<br/>I owe you more than myself<br/>and as magician his own wand,<br/><br/>I know she's by herself,<br/>and I fear and cannot stand<br/>the terror about itself.<br/><br/>Even under cloudy sky,<br/>wherever I look or live<br/>I can see your closed eye,<br/><br/>I feel your ending lie,<br/>I live my ending so sad life,<br/>and sense being about to die.<br/><br/>And I look at myself understanding I am<br/>who cannot stand a whisper<br/>cause to reach the sky walljumper<br/>is not enough,<br/>is not enough.<br/><br/>Luckily there is a flower<br/>thank to it I revive my hope,<br/>to us exchanging power,<br/><br/>thank to it I can recover,<br/>cause before no, I'd had nope,<br/>and mine was ending lover.<br/><br/>Spreading wawe of fading love,<br/>hit the wall and be pushed back,<br/>or just jump up and crush the hive.<br/><br/>No, you cannot hide.<br/>Not any more.<br/>Let<br/>you get<br/>the spear into the core.
