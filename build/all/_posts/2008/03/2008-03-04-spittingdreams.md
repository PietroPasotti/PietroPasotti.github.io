Silence, not any<br/>more thrilling imminence<br/>for me, sad and clumsy,<br/>trying to have some patience.<br/><br/>Illogical calculations are<br/>meaningless,<br/>finally useless,<br/>less than heaven now for,<br/><br/>Like if I believed in it,<br/>like if I really thought<br/>that I'd have soon caught<br/>the fruits that now I spit.
