Are you sure you now feel,<br/>ready to world dark impact,<br/>solid walls and harder soil?<br/><br/>(You're not in fact.)<br/><br/>Are you sure you now feel,<br/>ready to crash the ground,<br/>and sense tear off your soul?<br/><br/>(Way to me still haven't found.)<br/><br/>Look for a silent hood,<br/>sad as my palest mood,<br/>in which a guy crying stood<br/>sitting under a dead wood,<br/><br/>singing.<br/><br/>Glancing<br/>at me you see<br/>this isn't the ocean you<br/>expected to be<br/>but through and through<br/>you to me<br/>look like plain moon.<br/><br/>Fifty-one, sounds like end<br/>but it's all but it,<br/>it's beginning of a defeat,<br/>a deserted island, inside strand,<br/>and no way out,<br/>no one in, no one seen,<br/>worse couldn't have been,<br/>I'll have to fight for shout.<br/><br/>From now on will be the<br/>serenity, the peace before<br/>the jump, the silence<br/>waiting for my sore.
