Giving you myself and full<br/>give you all I deeper feel<br/>and like, all I love and hate,<br/>put into your hands my fate.<br/><br/>Share with you me into deep,<br/>see how you are, and<br/>most of all, see in the end<br/>who you are and what you keep.<br/><br/>That is what I'm calling fusion,<br/>this is what seems to be heart;<br/>love may reign upon the earth,<br/>but in me just bring confusion.<br/><br/>I feel now willied like a boy<br/>near to death, for no reason<br/>at all, but why may a guy<br/>just die if nothing's on?<br/><br/>Cause no reason's not nothing,<br/>may be me or may be you, but<br/>to me's now still everything,<br/>and it's getting shut and shut.<br/><br/>Lucid way to remind me to<br/>become myself as more as I can,<br/>to let it all and more to you,<br/>to let it lay upon the sun.<br/><br/>I know you won't hear me<br/>any more, I know it's all I<br/>have of you, but if once could be,<br/>I'd love even to see it passing by.<br/><br/><span>Written after having finished the Symposion, by Plato.<br/></span>
