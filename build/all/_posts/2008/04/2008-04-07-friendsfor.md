Hope goes far,<br/>friends for,<br/>and I still so do,<br/>I still think I can go<br/>and then return,<br/>but I'm afraid<br/>of finding others,<br/>I don't wanna let my love get burn.<br/><br/>Yes I do,<br/>Yes I love you,<br/>yes it's another way<br/>of living life 'n say<br/>I admire and think and thought<br/>you were the best of who for I fought.<br/><br/>If I can I will come back<br/>just to see you all for another year,<br/>just to run far from another fear,<br/>so as to end the begun match.<br/><br/>Friends for,<br/>hope goes far,<br/>and I know I can get<br/>to begin another war,<br/>and my love winning it let.
