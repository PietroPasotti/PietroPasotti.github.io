That in front of me chair empty<br/>make me feel like it and stone,<br/>as when I don't see you, watery<br/>get my eyes which used to shine.<br/><br/>I'm afraid these songs are sad and dry,<br/>but I'm just like that<br/>and if I can't manage to cry<br/>let me simply ask by words what.<br/><br/>And speaking words that may be<br/>shut up, I can only think<br/>how much I miss you and we,<br/><br/>how much I love our brief<br/>speaking, how much I blink<br/>to drab luck, to life so grief.
