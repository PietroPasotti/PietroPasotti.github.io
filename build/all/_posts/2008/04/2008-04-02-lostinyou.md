Lost in you<br/>through and through,<br/>must but cannot find<br/>myself, dust in wind.<br/><br/>Selfdestruct myself<br/>will get,<br/>death in end will meet,<br/>and sadness will find in itself<br/><br/>Sad because I am,<br/>circle of pain<br/>and tears like rain,<br/>portal to unknown take I can.<br/><br/>Ready to goodbye,<br/>not now, nor even never,<br/>I'm up to set the river,<br/>from my eyes to world entire.
