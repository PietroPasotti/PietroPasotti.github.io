Seed of death<br/>can rise from beneath,<br/>can sudden throw up<br/>all things you most tried to wrap,<br/><br/>can and will eat you out<br/>of your own mind, no shout<br/>or magic will or could<br/>broke into its darkness shield,<br/><br/>that's seed of death,<br/>and will grow on your wet<br/>pillow, under your softest<br/><br/>moment, which is the last.<br/>And so can live the dark,<br/>and so can't die the shark.
