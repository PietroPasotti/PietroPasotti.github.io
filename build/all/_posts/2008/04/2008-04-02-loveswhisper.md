Way of doing, way of being,<br/>you should try to better know<br/>who in truth are you,<br/>so as to live yourself accepting,<br/><br/>cause to me it seems<br/>you don't.<br/>You probably know I won't<br/>be here any longer, rays<br/><br/>yours so as to look,<br/>cause you know you mine shook.<br/><br/>You owe yourself<br/>somehow, the whisper of love<br/>that I don't deserve, dove,<br/>which just is what wanted myself.<br/><br/>I'd love you knowing<br/>better your deeper soul,<br/>so as not to maul<br/>in this sadness valley running.
