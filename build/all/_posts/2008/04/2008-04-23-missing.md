Try to me to you away run,<br/>and try to true us beings rate,<br/>missing you wherever we are,<br/>losing you a bit more every time,<br/>getting closer to ruin your heart,<br/>you so high and hatred art,<br/>stop stop that if we still can,<br/>stop that till it's not too late;<br/><br/>stop stop that stop<br/>all we have is a shy embrace<br/>my least futile lost smile<br/>my silent love and secret one,<br/><br/>my reddening glancing and<br/>frightening dreams,<br/>it's the only saying your eyes beam,<br/>nothing's what I could to you in end.<br/><br/>I'm feeling weak<br/>I'm going to break<br/>we're going to slash our lives<br/>in silly trying to catch windy leaves,<br/>shot in air my arms<br/>shot to happy in my lone head people<br/>dreaming my own dreams<br/>till last I could, so as to prevent the cripple<br/><br/>that's now incoming.<br/>Tower tower falling down,<br/>flower flower down to wind,<br/>power power in your mind<br/>that's now vanishing<br/>that's now getting due to me too far,<br/>shelves empty without you,<br/>in house of my old lone home<br/>lost in fields<br/>of clouds<br/>in eye sky;<br/><br/>shout shout silent shout<br/>and waste your brain<br/>in lone nightmares,<br/>miss yourself in lone<br/>hunt of werewolves<br/>and see the white of running<br/>pray's eyes,<br/>run run<br/>and do not come back,<br/>don't try again to see what brought you down<br/>not to cry again for sad things wearing off,<br/><br/>implore my mind pity<br/>for defeated ally of my own dream.<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">A Serena (Ritrovata dispersa il 13/o9/09)...</span>
