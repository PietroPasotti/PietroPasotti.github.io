Even if<br/>I am so sad and selfish<br/>in an unknown way<br/><br/>I can only pray<br/>for you happy being, and wish<br/>all good things.<br/><br/>In a different way I am not sad,<br/>in a strange way I am also mad,<br/>but what's more,<br/><br/>I feel I love you<br/>even more I hate myself,<br/>that means I might be safe.<br/><br/>Even if we're friends,<br/>I realize you didn't get me,<br/>as you thought we may not be,<br/><br/>as you thought I wanted you for me.<br/>I'm sorry, you're wrong,<br/>I'm all but strong<br/><br/>and don't you know,<br/>you are.<br/>I'm in front of you bare,<br/><br/>lone and weak,<br/>once and twice again broke,<br/>as to you I stroke.<br/><br/>Thank you.
