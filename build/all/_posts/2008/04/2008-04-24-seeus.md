See<br/>you're to me<br/>and to you, through and through,<br/>who you are supposed to be.<br/><br/>All I want is not to see<br/>what has been and has to be,<br/>which to horizon I let flee,<br/>who to me forced set free,<br/><br/>and sorry again as I am bee,<br/>as I followed the dream of we,<br/>could have been or cannot the<br/>image of us growing a tree.<br/><br/>Shame or blame you should shut<br/>doors, set 'em houses with no floors, but<br/>you don't, I know you do,<br/><br/>yes you show you're sorry too,<br/>but that's to me, in me, not us,<br/>and I hug to you even more than has.<br/><br/>See<br/>you're to me<br/>and to you, through and through,<br/>who you are supposed to be.
