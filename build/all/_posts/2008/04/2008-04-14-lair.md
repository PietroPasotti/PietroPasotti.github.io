Hitting out who made me alive<br/>who in the end killed me twice<br/>and as a cat with mice<br/>I hunt down who me shove.<br/><br/>I didn't mean to hate<br/>you two, I did not want<br/>but really can't<br/>not mind you burned my fate,<br/><br/>you covered me in despair.<br/>I've never said you, never<br/>I will do, and revenge is my fever<br/><br/>you can't cure in my lair,<br/>wounded beast slashing intruders<br/>I didn't mean to make you marauders.
