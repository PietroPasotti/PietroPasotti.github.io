Alone as I feel I'd love<br/>a way to hold and let,<br/>to save you but bet<br/>I won't get this way to move.<br/><br/>As you know who I am<br/>you'd know who you are<br/>to you and me, can<br/>you see so far?<br/><br/>Your home's dead,<br/>windows are closed,<br/>though we both cried,<br/><br/>we both lied,<br/>but love is pure and untouched<br/>as we wait our life to lead.
