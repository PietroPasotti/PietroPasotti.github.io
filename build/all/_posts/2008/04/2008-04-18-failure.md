You firm hold my arm<br/>when no one else does<br/>you joke 'n embrace<br/><br/>in most truthful lace,<br/>you even don't mind shoes<br/>we wear and over all your charm<br/><br/>taught me again to smile.<br/>Under of clouds a mile<br/>you've been with me while<br/>my own dream world was failing,<br/><br/>my own head was falling,<br/>and even if I did not show,<br/>all things I loved away threw<br/>and seed of death instead grew.
