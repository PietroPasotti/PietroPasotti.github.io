Destroyed down to knees,<br/>pulled by an invisible,<br/>unavoidable,<br/>heavy weight  that is<br/><br/>what I cannot lift,<br/>what I never shift,<br/>for nothing on world,<br/>never and never would.<br/><br/>As I haven't still found<br/>to tell you how I love,<br/>the right and perfect sound,<br/><br/>I hope these few lone rhymes<br/>can make you seem the dove<br/>you are to me and myselves.
