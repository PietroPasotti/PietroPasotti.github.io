Now I'm standing up,<br/>go down stairs,<br/>take the bike and ride<br/>till there,<br/>in heart a map<br/>trying to hide,<br/>but I hold it in my hand,<br/><br/>and when I'll be running fast<br/>as in the darkness,<br/>like I did every night so far,<br/>I'll be loneless,<br/>but indeed alone with me.<br/><br/>I used to say I'm alright<br/>but I wasn't and will<br/>never be, my flight<br/>is not yet over, but my will<br/><br/>explode.<br/><br/>Seed is not yet grown,<br/>as it doesn't want being shown.
