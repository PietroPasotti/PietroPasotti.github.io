When all was over, looked<br/>down and saw a seed,<br/>took it up and watched,<br/>was just water that it need.<br/><br/>Plant it down, in the earth,<br/>feed it and will grow up,<br/>even if comes from heart,<br/>of a so unhappy pup.<br/><br/>Plants than me are stronger,<br/>and everyone there,<br/>can only try to wonder,<br/><br/>what makes me love that tree,<br/>that was grew up by lover,<br/>as only her might see.
