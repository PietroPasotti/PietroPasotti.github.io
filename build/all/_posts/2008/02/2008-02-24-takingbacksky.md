Coming a road back,<br/>runnin' with my bicycle,<br/>tryin' to world recycle,<br/>avoiding smoky truck,<br/><br/>I finally reached up park<br/>our table, trees and lane,<br/>just was yesterday's bone,<br/>everythin' looked no dark,<br/><br/>leaves looked green and roses<br/>blossoms, but all just was<br/>somehow grey and those<br/>who were red now loses<br/><br/>colour and consistence,<br/>may be due to absence,<br/>inconsistence of the world's nonsense.<br/><br/>Find a sense, find a way,<br/>to make it all seem just less gray.
