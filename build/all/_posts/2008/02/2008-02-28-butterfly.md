Some lone butterflies slowly<br/>flying, wings quickly<br/>waving, so high can fly<br/>away, going far by,<br/>touching direct sky,<br/>noone can catch it, why?<br/>Cause it'sa a butterfly,<br/>and will forever slip away,<br/>after so many desperate try,<br/>it will manage anyway<br/>to go up to skies every day.<br/>There's nothing you can say,<br/>you can just stop and in grass lay,<br/>trying to watch it, and cry.<br/>And was it thursday,<br/>was it friday,<br/>you won't go along till next monday,<br/>and will yourself in sadness slay,<br/>cause men are all but sly.<br/>As there is nothing to pay,<br/>I just try to watch beauty,<br/>feeling it as a sort of duty,<br/>I owe somehow to my inner eye.
