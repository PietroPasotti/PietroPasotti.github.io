Rain inside,<br/>nothing outside,<br/>do you think it's correct?<br/>Do you mind me to reflect<br/>what I feel and how much I ache,<br/>in or out my silent face?<br/><br/>Should I fall, as it's gonna happen<br/>or I'd wait for it to come then,<br/>and slash me out and in,<br/>and slay me out myself within.<br/><br/>So<br/>it's how it ends<br/>so,<br/>it's now beginning,<br/>so,<br/>we'll here be crying,<br/>for you all best friends.
