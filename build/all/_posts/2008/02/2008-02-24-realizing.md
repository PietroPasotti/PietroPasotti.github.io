I realize I've never known you,<br/>and I'm sorry, I'll that regret,<br/>but I'll not break your secret,<br/>cause you'll have reasons, true.<br/><br/>But I'm sorry, sorry to the end<br/>I should have been a better friend<br/>and now that I go to foreign land,<br/>I've lost any hope to see you land.<br/><br/>Don't give up, even if I don't<br/>know who you are,<br/>what you do,<br/>and not even who is who.<br/>I like who you seem to be,<br/>but I'll never dare,<br/>to ask you giving me<br/>what you couldn't want.<br/><br/>Don't leave as fallen leaves,<br/>as cats you've nine lives,<br/>but cannot return who leaves,<br/>even if in heart still lives.<br/><br/>Good luck, friend.
