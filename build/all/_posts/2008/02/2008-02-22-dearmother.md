Hurricane came over,<br/>took me as a forgotten child,<br/>I ran out forgetting cover,<br/>looked at you as a mother, wild.<br/><br/>Uncatchable, unobtainable,<br/>slippy as black-blue soap<br/>so high, unbelievable,<br/>my huge heart made a leap.<br/><br/>Thank you, so-called flower,<br/>what for, so-dear son?<br/>For being a so-great mother,<br/><br/>so thank you, so-dear gone<br/>why, so-called flower?<br/>For leaving me, crimson, alone.
