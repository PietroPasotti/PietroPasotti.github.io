Repression is the right word<br/>to express how this world<br/>is tryin to give me ward<br/>and say me It'll be hard.<br/><br/>Fear of living,<br/>fear of loving,<br/>fear to leave behind the more<br/>thing that will happen, sure.<br/><br/>Lifear, to say how I'm afraid,<br/>to say, to live and full enjoy,<br/>to watch the last days before raid,<br/>before the moment I'll go away.<br/><br/>Lifear, to translate the word<br/>that's most used in this world<br/>to say that this is a ward<br/>for things coming so hard.
