Are so many metres?<br/>Are there so many lives,<br/>so many longer miles,<br/>that our homes separes?<br/><br/>Is there any true reason,<br/>any real mistake,<br/>for you me abandon,<br/>that I ever take?<br/><br/>So why I feel so distant,<br/>why I see so dark'n foggy,<br/>and cannot watch a pleasant<br/><br/>gust like you so cloudy?<br/>I've worked like a peasant,<br/>and no way see you, moody.
