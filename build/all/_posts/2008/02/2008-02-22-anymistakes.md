And what if, dear one,<br/>we just made mistakes?<br/>Who else can stand alone,<br/>taking what it takes?<br/><br/>Strong tree, don't fall,<br/>even in the rainy wind<br/>I'll sure hear your call<br/>and I'll come, to you find.<br/><br/>And what if, true love,<br/>my seed won't grow up?<br/>Who else can grow a grove<br/>and drink a sadness cup?<br/><br/>Weak boy, fall down,<br/>let that be the last,<br/>in the black-dark down,<br/>let that go away fast.
