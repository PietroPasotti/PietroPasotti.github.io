More and more alone I feel<br/>full of tears for those who fell.<br/>May be cause of fallin' hell,<br/>may be cause of life's wheel.<br/><br/>When earthquake brokes up earth,<br/>the more you jump,<br/>the more you avoid the bump,<br/>so you can plan up your chart.<br/><br/>See the ocean in my eye,<br/>see reflection of the sky,<br/>fix it, don't let it go by,<br/>I know you all are sly.
