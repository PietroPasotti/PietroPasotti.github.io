Every little moment<br/>seems a day without you,<br/>not even decent<br/>to be lived so through.<br/><br/>Every little instant<br/>that I live within you,<br/>seems so important<br/>I wouldn't face the true,<br/><br/>the evidence, the proof,<br/>that not even in dreams<br/>our lives are over world roof.<br/><br/>Indeed further reams<br/>soon seem slightly spoof,<br/>so lands without names.
