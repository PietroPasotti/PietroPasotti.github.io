<br/>               <p>My heart's losing<br/>beats so weak<br/>mistakes are overcoming,<br/>my world's gonna break.</p> <p>I hate these little actions,<br/>these moments so outcrying,<br/>sign in me of factions,<br/>so conflict, so dying.</p> <p>Starving love, starving soul,<br/>food's here, but cannot get it,<br/>so I cry so hard I howl,<br/>cause I'm afraid of what I'll meet.</p> <p>So hard you can hear it,<br/>so pale you can smell it,<br/>so sad you can cry it,<br/>so mad you wanna break.</p>       <br/>
