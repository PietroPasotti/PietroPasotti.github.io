<br/>               <p>Never turn it back,<br/>never mess what's less,<br/>may be sign of lack,<br/>may be cry of illness.</p> <p>Even when you fall,<br/>even where you go,<br/>let it be the all,<br/>let em what you do.</p> <p>What is that so crying,<br/>what so many tears,<br/>all the fears are rising,<br/>all say goodbye my dears.</p> <p>Soon Emblem may want<br/>to come there, well,<br/>as you wish, as I, hell,<br/>ever hoped but can't.</p>       <br/>
