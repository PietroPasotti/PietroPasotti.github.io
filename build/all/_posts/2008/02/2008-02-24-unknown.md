That is how I am unknown,<br/>am I so selfish, so unpolite?<br/>Just cause love her skin so white,<br/>all the years, away thrown.<br/><br/>That is how it's gonna end,<br/>due to me and my depression,<br/>all just caused by depression,<br/>reached no one, not even friend.<br/><br/>Soon you'll see me cry,<br/>as I've ever wanted,<br/>but never realized,<br/>how much can hurt fly.<br/><br/>And so I'm gonna end,<br/>in a lone great street,<br/>only squirrel's land.<br/><br/>So will burn defeat,<br/>alone in desert sand,<br/>don't ask me to repeat.<br/><br/>Indeed, who else can stand,<br/>come with me, hold my hat,<br/>until world's end?<br/><br/>Just a person I'm gonna call,<br/>call to me, to us away,<br/>to hold my hand before the fall.<br/><br/>You owe me, unknown friend,<br/>so try not to away send,<br/>what I cannot mend.<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">To who can manage to read sad things once, and only once again.<br/></span>
