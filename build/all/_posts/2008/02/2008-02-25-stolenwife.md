And so my dear stolen wife,<br/>thank for mending our broken life,<br/>all I need is not to strife,<br/>all you give is more than rife.<br/><br/>I believe<br/>you are<br/>one of these so little girls,<br/>with indeed so bigger hearts,<br/>how far,<br/>so, I'll leave,<br/><br/>I won't be there any more for you,<br/>for you and all the others. Through<br/>the eyes: you don't need to<br/>speak, all you think is what you do.<br/><br/>You gave me my last<br/>smile, and even if I'm lost,<br/>I'll take you as a dot,<br/>so as the last white door, in the end spot.<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">To my wife, after three years, still waiting for honeymoon.</span>
