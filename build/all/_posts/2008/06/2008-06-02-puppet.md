Illiterate I feel as anyone but poets,<br/>sad and more as I know my inner,<br/>dour and still under tears shower<br/>I can sense the heart of older prophets,<br/><br/>who said me to prepare to pang,<br/>though I weren't enough for breeze,<br/>and wind decide to stun me freeze,<br/>and his slaves were to move me along.<br/><br/>Puppet in hands of wind we got<br/>till here, this doomed land of spirits,<br/>unworthy stun and missing clouds,<br/><br/>but weight of too many frouds<br/>crashed me on wind's wings,<br/>and I crowl like worms I hunted.
