Why hasn't still the silver<br/>bullet shot down stone<br/>the golden lover,<br/>the newly chosen one?<br/><br/>We've ran,<br/>luck agains the passion,<br/>tears in the depression,<br/>and we're gone.<br/><br/>We're maybe so much<br/>that we can't touch<br/>and I know each<br/>one'd feel the reach.
