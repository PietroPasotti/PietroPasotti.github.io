On and on forgetting things,<br/>and right now out me slipped<br/>that I could've forgotten life,<br/><br/>so I go on and we go along,<br/>and in avoiding darkness' stings,<br/>we all get we're far from rife.<br/><br/>Will I understand the biggest<br/>gift world gave me, will I get<br/>you've all the way I wanted let<br/><br/>me live? So on and on forgetting<br/>things, as I walk, fly or even rest,<br/>I look again behind my many steps,<br/><br/>and astonished staring at my<br/>so bloody path, I cry like if<br/>my own heart was full of ashes.<br/><br/>And lighter now, without the many<br/>tons of slimy blood, I finally feel like<br/>I could fly away. Hold me on.
