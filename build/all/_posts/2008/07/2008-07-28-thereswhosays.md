There's who says,<br/>about me and thousands others,<br/>without knowing,<br/>simply wondering,<br/><br/>we are nobody and we should do,<br/>instead of running away from home,<br/><br/>even if our own world is black,<br/>we only could some death get back.<br/><br/>There's who says,<br/>I am a refugee and a coward,<br/>without knowing,<br/>simply wondering,<br/><br/>I flee this place and time,<br/>just to get some peace of mine,<br/><br/>and what about my life,<br/>if all I get to me is knife.<br/><br/>There's who says,<br/>I am to care some more the living,<br/>without knowing,<br/>simply wondering,<br/><br/>but what if I were about,<br/>to abandon them and now turns out,<br/><br/>something so strong to make me walk,<br/>someone so good to make heart talk.<br/><br/>There's who says,<br/>I should believe in something more,<br/>without knowing,<br/>simply wondering,<br/><br/>and they don't know we are,<br/>parts of our stories and we care,<br/><br/>we don't wait for something else,<br/>and we believe in what's not false.<br/><br/>There's who says,<br/>I should not leave this world,<br/>without knowing,<br/>simply wondering,<br/><br/>but if once a week I make me strong,<br/>if I don't take my chances wrong,<br/><br/>and if I get my steps for living,<br/>they wouldn't get easy to believing.<br/><br/>Would you know,<br/>the secrets I'm keeping,<br/>would you know,<br/>the dread I'm stalking,<br/><br/>can you stand,<br/>the pain of the weakest soul,<br/>can you handle,<br/>the pieces of a broken puzzle?<br/><br/>Or maybe I cannot say,<br/>my life isn't all there,<br/>perhaps I'm to be here,<br/>but my heart is free to fly.
