You're a place where tomorrow is another story,<br/>I'm almost desperate as luck's lost his glory,<br/><br/>you're a world to be just tasted,<br/>with the top of tongue not to be blamed,<br/><br/>you're a wise and curious stranger,<br/>in a steam neverending tower,<br/><br/>without any fear slashing darkness,<br/>looking for corals in sea deepness,<br/><br/>to bring to light and make grow higher;<br/>you're somehow a hidden flower,<br/><br/>to be found and kept safe,<br/>or nobody would bear the shame.<br/><br/>You're the way everyone desires,<br/>we can't know how is who loves,<br/><br/>till we see you looking far away,<br/>your heartbeat in silence as we pray,<br/><br/>we can't imagine how seems perfection,<br/>if we ignore your eyes' direction.<br/><br/>And if we are what we seem to be,<br/>then my heart is to be free,<br/><br/>as I dreamed and cried so many times,<br/>but smile's here and my legs in vines,<br/><br/>open arms and wait to come for you,<br/>but can't wait for something to do,<br/><br/>and thoughts are pointless this way,<br/>I don't wanna lose my brightest day.<br/><br/>Don't be afraid as with you I'm strong,<br/>and I'm the tower and cannot feel pang,<br/><br/>and you could stun me but can't be hit,<br/>this may be wrong but that's how's it,<br/><br/>that is me and you must know,<br/>what a good day for me to show.<br/><br/>Silence silence what a good feeling,<br/>perhaps my heart only now believing.<br/><br/>To You...
