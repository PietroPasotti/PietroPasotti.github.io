Would I feel like a sort of worm,<br/>if what we built over ancient chaos,<br/>because of me and my fool actions,<br/>was torn apart cause I wrong behave?<br/><br/>All the things I used to say,<br/>would be all crazy to rely,<br/>cause I think that my emotions<br/>are mad as the one who embody,<br/><br/>to the angels I thought I love,<br/>to the white-winged daemons I thought I follow,<br/>to the people I wanted and's never been,<br/>I bow, I bow goodbye. Goodbye.<br/><br/>Could I be the best one ever,<br/>could you be the first and last,<br/>could it be the only fable,<br/>and what if we end up lost?<br/><br/>I'd love to be who maybe I'm not,<br/>but I'll try I swear to make good things,<br/>and everything will seem so sweet,<br/>we'll have to force our way to grave,<br/><br/>and what if there won't be need,<br/>and what if we really are,<br/>and what if we wanna be,<br/>each other's one and only love?<br/><br/>To the angels I thought I love,<br/>to the white-winged daemons I thought I follow,<br/>to the people I wanted and's never been,<br/>I bow, I bow goodbye. Goodbye.<br/><br/>Sometimes emotions aren't so simple,<br/>but if we're strong and I am not,<br/>but if we're together and we will be,<br/>we'll all be happy or we'll see.<br/><br/>I wanna live to see this ending,<br/>I wanna look and stay up watching,<br/>I wanna feel and give you slices<br/>of my own heart just full of ashes,<br/><br/>I wanna let you take my best parts,<br/>I wanna try the trees to wind,<br/>I wanna force my way to heaven,<br/>and we'll all see how it's to do.<br/><br/>To the angels I thought I love,<br/>to the white-winged daemons I thought I follow,<br/>to the people I wanted and's never been<br/>I bow, I bow goodbye. Goodbye.<br/><br/>Now goodbye I hope so far,<br/>cause we trade our hearts, and I owe her mine,<br/>cause I feel like mine has been so lone,<br/>I tried with you but we won't be,<br/><br/>I tried to be your best friend ever,<br/>but we threw our arms in wrong directions,<br/>maybe we'd loved or we will do,<br/>maybe I am to fly with you.<br/><br/>Maybe we were or we will be,<br/>the couple of friends no one has seen,<br/>the mates of ever and the never,<br/>the dragons firing a world of doom,<br/><br/>maybe I love you and maybe I don't,<br/>we'll never know but time will show,<br/>as my new breeze is overcoming,<br/>and I won't be any longer waiting,<br/><br/>all I wanted was more of you,<br/>and if the world will be seen greener,<br/>we'll all be caused by your lovely kisses,<br/>or we'll all be far from life.<br/><br/>To the angels I thought I love,<br/>to the white-winged daemons I thought I follow,<br/>to the people I wanted and's never been<br/>I bow, I bow goodbye. Goodbye.<br/><br/>But in the end the peace I show,<br/>may be greater than the crisis I wanted,<br/>and if I'd been to live till now,<br/>well I'm proud of you and who loved me,<br/><br/>if I had to fight for this heart,<br/>well maybe I have done well,<br/>well maybe I am to die now,<br/>but this will be shown in the night,<br/><br/>I know I have failed,<br/>I know I've missed you much,<br/>you know exactly how to face me,<br/>and so now please tell me I'm wrong,<br/><br/>and if it's not I'll burn in shame,<br/>and if it is I'll be so happy,<br/>for a day and night the moon will stop,<br/>because I know I am so weak.<br/><br/>Let this perfect silence fill the sky,<br/>let it slip thru every leaf,<br/>let it make thru every heart,<br/>let it burn thru who lost his one,<br/><br/>let this thinking boy leave his world safe,<br/>let him place a bomb upon the cruels,<br/>let his loved be in peace with fire,<br/>and in the end let her be happy.<br/><br/>I want this odd song to be read in nights,<br/>when you feel more lone and far away,<br/>let it lighten your sad days,<br/>let it sadden every moment,<br/><br/>let it squeeze your heart till tears,<br/>cause so many are to be poured,<br/>and I think it's so good thing,<br/>I think we should cry every moment,<br/><br/>I think a tear with a truthful smile,<br/>altogether and not enemies,<br/>would be able to crunch every silence,<br/>would fetch you the key for happiness.<br/><br/>To the angels I thought I love,<br/>to the white-winged daemons I thought I follow,<br/>to the people I wanted and's never been<br/>I bow, I bow goodbye. Goodbye.<br/><br/>And this song would never end,<br/>as there're too many things to say,<br/>but I'm sure you'll understand,<br/>I'll be there for you to talk,<br/><br/>so goodbye maybe only friend,<br/>let's see tomorrow or another day,<br/>but make it come as soon as you can,<br/>cause alone I'm only me,<br/><br/>altogether we are the one,<br/>and hand in hand we'll see the end,<br/>or the beginning of something else,<br/>we might only ask the moon.<br/><br/>We all are pieces of broken puzzles,<br/>and it's so hard to put together,<br/>but we have made this and more and more,<br/>we'd love to watch the hidden photo,<br/><br/>and what if we'll be watching sun,<br/>and what if we'll stand to ourselves,<br/>and what if we'll see each other,<br/>hope will be the most right ever.<br/><br/>To the angels I thought I love,<br/>to the white-winged daemons I thought I follow,<br/>to the people I wanted and's never been<br/>I bow, I bow goodbye. Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.<br/><br/>To Serena, to Anna, to us, to all of us.  To everyone.
