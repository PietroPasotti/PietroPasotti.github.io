Can't take your hand I know nothing,<br/>let me see and I'll own the world,<br/>I'll know what to ask and when not to,<br/>so I beg you forgive my own mistaking,<br/><br/>I'll believe your words eyes are far until,<br/>I do share my heart and you're here still,<br/>so I trust and you make me believe<br/>we're together and we will thrive,<br/><br/>we're as one and we deserve some more,<br/>if you'll want someday we'll dull life share.
