There are times<br/>beside the aches brought by wind,<br/>in which you would<br/>truly neglect your jamming mind,<br/>in which<br/>if just you could,<br/>you'd have born again to see<br/>who are you and who's in me,<br/>here I am for you to believe,<br/>here you are spreading out in my heart,<br/>I'm defenceless and I wouldn't tear apart<br/>the only smile's getting through,<br/>and I look then better it is you.<br/><br/>I look forward to live some days,<br/>and as I'm with you every second delays,<br/>since for the better<br/>it doesn't matter,<br/>since as the light<br/>is so bright<br/>we don't need to fight the clock,<br/>we are weak but can get through.
