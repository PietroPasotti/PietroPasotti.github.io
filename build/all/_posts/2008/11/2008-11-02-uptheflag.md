Our world is set to be,<br/>to be believing,<br/>I think it's me,<br/>did you think it's everything,<br/>that is going to watch enjoying,<br/>us in chains,<br/>our hands up blowing,<br/>our damned brains...<br/><br/>Up the flag for the departing,<br/>bow the flail to the once failing,<br/>that has made the fool leaving,<br/>this mad world and madly crying,<br/><br/>up the flag,<br/>down the chairs,<br/>sit down the room before,<br/>on the glacier that's our floor,<br/>float on hands in pairs,<br/>kiss your mate and wait for us,<br/>we won't come it's just because,<br/>we don't exist,<br/>we're made in mist,<br/>made in flags and wind's our master,<br/>so sit down and wait for disaster...
