Off the lights,<br/>bring me home,<br/>stop the fights,<br/>smile the dome,<br/>to the peace and the delights,<br/>they're about to come,<br/>they're lone mights,<br/>bring me some,<br/>word are never rights,<br/>but no one's to blame.<br/><br/>We may point,<br/>any dark shape,<br/>but that's the joint,<br/>between us and ape,<br/>I say you I'm to faint,<br/>you'd believe me mate,<br/>as there's no more pained,<br/>whose fault is it, fate?<br/>But why am I so crazed...
