Knock on that gate,<br/>in face you spit the fate,<br/>burying under the hate<br/>your ancient breastplate,<br/><br/>a sculpture of finest tremor,<br/>you tore apart your humour,<br/>since you saw a thing above horror,<br/>and can't beneath the sorrow<br/><br/>see the edge of the sea you swallowed.<br/>Element.
