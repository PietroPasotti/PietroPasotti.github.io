Clean now up air to lighten dreams<br/>to be easy drunk as I sleepwalk,<br/>to calm me down as I kick the shadows,<br/>to let me once over clouds walk.<br/><br/>White rainy origin for a light new<br/>paper, blank psychic blackboard<br/>for a snowy sky, and under it you,<br/>you repeat standing what you heard,<br/><br/>you scream as lion out your lungs<br/>just to get by another chain  bound<br/>will make drown your heavy pangs<br/><br/>and with 'em yourself and foam around<br/>and all of this will dispel as bell rings,<br/>all the buildings will fall down and wound.
