Numbers show now themselves lawless<br/>as anybody else here, and the more<br/>the countdown went on, I swore<br/>to everyone still there my weakness,<br/><br/>damned myself as any other soulless,<br/>the more I saw with upcoming sun<br/>my head start falling from lower won,<br/>and now I stand still looking at ashes mess.<br/><br/>What then if I wasn't the one, if destiny<br/>is as real as my tears right now, if I<br/>was just supposed to lose to rainy<br/><br/>day offered to me cruelly life by,<br/>if I acted as a puppet pale unwilling<br/>and the cables has been cut,  so why?
