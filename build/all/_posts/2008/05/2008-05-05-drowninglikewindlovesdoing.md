I want to be like wind<br/>that's now striking me back,<br/>I want to be the blizzard<br/>which is freezing my nose,<br/>and the moment for this<br/>is really close,<br/>and of my heart last shard<br/>is falling down to earth:<br/><br/>this may be.<br/><br/>So here I am,<br/>stuck in middle of a walkway<br/>waiting for a truck,<br/>there I see a lightning,<br/>then a bolt of pain,<br/>then just let my blood<br/>get washed by heavy rain:<br/><br/>this might be.<br/><br/>So here I am,<br/>and I still try to smell<br/>out flower's crown,<br/>an aroma which is<br/>not its own,<br/>cause it breathed<br/>it to hell, and it couldn't<br/>have been enough by himself<br/>to overpower flames,<br/><br/>this can't be.<br/><br/>So here I'd be going away,<br/>running free, and if it's alone<br/>then here I am,<br/>and if it's to be without you<br/>then I burn and back to you<br/>turn my eyes,<br/>and I go down<br/>again to rescue<br/>your drowning whisper.
