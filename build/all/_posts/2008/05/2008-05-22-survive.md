Ready pen pick up from so clear desk,<br/>tight in hand to draw blank letter,<br/>but who am I to who's so better,<br/>am I to afford or chase that risk?<br/><br/>Shame will pursue me till later,<br/>every day after this fallen pen,<br/>red its ink as it's the one of men,<br/>and I'm not to tear off my feather.<br/><br/>It's something built into me,<br/>before these walls came blinding,<br/>so I can just look wonder for the<br/><br/>rainbow's shadows I'm still dreaming,<br/>the fairy illusions I used to see,<br/>the ones I left and those I'm getting.
