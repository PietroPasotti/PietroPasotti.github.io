Continuously go on in trying to joke<br/>yourself, in thinking you're getting fake,<br/>never stop to fathom and fathom<br/>your own feelings, now make doom<br/><br/>of your life, seems so useless, never<br/>think you might know the brain forever,<br/>as it shapes from life to death,<br/>and you may free up your breath.<br/><br/>And in years and days<br/>and ever, break out your ways<br/>to reach the skies<br/><br/>you've already dark blue painted.
