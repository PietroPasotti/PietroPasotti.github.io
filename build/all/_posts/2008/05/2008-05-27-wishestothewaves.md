Now waves give me strength to lift the mountains,<br/>even if its so blown length<br/>is not enough to breakout the curtains,<br/><br/>so now by rivers fuse into me the boulders,<br/>and resist to me confuse<br/>as I get it's all but wonders.<br/><br/>Indeed after two or three new tries<br/>I know sudden to<br/>the rock isn't enough to fist lullabies,<br/><br/>and the only will that may succeed<br/>is the one like skill,<br/>the one I've never had but need,<br/><br/>is the lulling burning power of instability,<br/>that may bring<br/>earthquake to the top of towers' ability.<br/><br/>Even there there may be a man<br/>standing just up here,<br/>he exactly knows what he can,<br/><br/>as our misery isn't able to explore<br/>and so it's for the fable<br/>to make alive the whole about to explode.
