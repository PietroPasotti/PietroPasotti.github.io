Summing up how many of thousands<br/>of the coats I threw you did you pick<br/>and hold, watching me frozen in hands,<br/>thinking sad that many scars may break<br/><br/>even blazing out stars, as you think I am.<br/>So star are you, and too many light spikes<br/>wound eyes and deeper who can see you,<br/>and how could be tiny as strongest strikes?<br/><br/>Make now silence, shut up as world's again<br/>collapsing around me, once more I get hit,<br/>once more like if I'm not alone enough, pain<br/><br/>pangs me harder and so please make it<br/>stop, make that snow silence the rain,<br/>let it build white walls around world's beat.
