Half a boy,<br/>for half an heart,<br/>half a joy,<br/>for who's to start,<br/><br/>again again from zed to begin,<br/>let's look once more to me living,<br/>I won't believe the words I think,<br/>I just will follow the path you blink,<br/><br/>cry louder please I'll hear you,<br/>mutter softer and I'll be yours,<br/>if you want, as you desire,<br/>you're my kingdom I'm your empire.<br/><br/>When I look back once again,<br/>overcomes my heart the pain,<br/>let's not say I'm to be here,<br/>let's not ask for me to dare,<br/><br/>leaving that life, it was so pretty,<br/>holding this knife is really a pity,<br/><br/>nope, nope, nope,<br/>no hope, no hope,<br/>If I were stronger,<br/>I'd have the climber,<br/>already cut the rope,<br/><br/>leaving that life, it was so pretty,<br/>holding this knife is really a pity.<br/><br/>Serenity we're all denied,<br/>is the joy we all believed,<br/>so let's try the heave you go,<br/>I hope you'll find you too,<br/><br/>please believe the cries I mutter,<br/>please believe yours doesn't matter,<br/><br/>nope, nope, nope,<br/>no hope, no hope,<br/>If I were stronger,<br/>I'd have the climber,<br/>already cut the rope,<br/><br/>please believe the cries I mutter,<br/>please believe yours doesn't matter.<br/><br/>Do you believe,<br/>do I still believe,<br/><br/>nope, nope, nope,<br/> no hope, no hope,<br/> If I were stronger,<br/> I'd have the climber,<br/>already cut the rope,<br/><br/>somehow I still believe,<br/>couldn't be otherwise:<br/>we're still at sunrise,<br/>I love who made me grieve.
