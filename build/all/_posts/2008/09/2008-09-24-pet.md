Ashamed pet is down to you,<br/>overfeel the power it's within,<br/>covered in mud may seem,<br/>but so why his eyes are blue,<br/><br/>seem a glance so far home,<br/>a lightning fire into the trees,<br/>on the way dark one last kiss,<br/>so as alone not to feel alone,<br/><br/>it's like that and feels it is,<br/>open arms and till the ground,<br/>one last seed is to be proud,<br/><br/>to grow up and show me his<br/>pride and let me know will wear,<br/>for me till the end what I'm to bear.<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">To who manages to make me lough even now... Thank you...</span>
