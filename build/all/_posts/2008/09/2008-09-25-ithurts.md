As I hope it's over,<br/>it's a lie I'm there another,<br/>and it hurts, it hurts,<br/>again once more it hurts...<br/><br/>It's so difficult you know<br/>to stand every word,<br/>every single smile will be,<br/>it's so long but time will show.<br/><br/>Drawing plain views,<br/>of better worlds I dream,<br/>the war and peace stand together,<br/><br/>in the eyes and world air,<br/>and it hurts, it hurts,<br/>I didn't think but hurts...
