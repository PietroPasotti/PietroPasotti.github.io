He played with you,<br/>he played his lies,<br/>as a neverending tragedy,<br/>you've believed his cries,<br/><br/>he used to sing you<br/>his notes bring you high,<br/><br/>you had:<br/><br/>enough enough enough<br/>of who was to make you laugh,<br/>but lie after lie,<br/>only got to make you cry,<br/><br/>used to sing you...<br/><br/>You're no I know,<br/>you're just another,<br/>victim of his shatter,<br/>instead of high it's low,<br/><br/>over the rain you'd like to drink,<br/>it's shown sunlight will to you blink,<br/><br/>enough enough enough<br/>of who was to make you laugh,<br/>but lie after lie,<br/>only got to make you cry,<br/><br/>over the rain...<br/><br/>Refugee your world<br/>or flee your own,<br/>bruise the chorus<br/>reminding you your duty,<br/><br/>and the embers you'd swallow,<br/>seem now the only light to follow,<br/><br/>enough enough enough<br/>of who was to make you laugh,<br/>but lie after lie,<br/>only got to make you cry,<br/><br/>the only light to follow...<br/><br/>Loud aloud and louder now,<br/>in the forest hear the noise,<br/>of some shoot pure into his heart,<br/>see the cries of nature torn apart,<br/><br/>plead of being all you were not,<br/>who you love or's best a knot,<br/><br/>enough enough enough<br/>of who was to make you laugh,<br/>but lie after lie,<br/>only got to make you cry,<br/><br/>best a knot around your neck...<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">To the liars or their victims. </span>
