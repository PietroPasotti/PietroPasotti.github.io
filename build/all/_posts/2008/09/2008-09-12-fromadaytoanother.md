From a day to another,<br/>filled with the last nothing,<br/>if you feel you're feeling<br/>it's just a trace of fire,<br/><br/>what the sparkle left behind,<br/>in a single blow of alone wind.<br/><br/>You lose balance and can't rely,<br/>on the drab way seems reality.<br/><br/>You open eyes on the lane,<br/>you realize your life's alone.<br/><br/>I seem pregnant of my own misery,<br/>it looks like I am a sort of dreaming fool,<br/>but I know I'll feel just freezing cool,<br/>and you won't part my dull atrocity.
