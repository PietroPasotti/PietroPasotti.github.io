This is perhaps a lesson<br/>to every single rotten blossom,<br/><br/>how to lock up your brain,<br/>once the damage's done,<br/>since you threw up shone,<br/>all things you loved in vain.<br/><br/>My life may seem so lazy,<br/>I looked for something pretty,<br/>but's just driving me crazy,<br/>throughout my eye and ditty,<br/><br/>I couldn't write a thing,<br/>I couldn't really neither see,<br/>I could not fly any wing,<br/>because I'm only you and me.<br/><br/>I sing now to me and to you,<br/>whoever you are I see you too,<br/><br/>how to lock up your brain,<br/>once the damage's done,<br/>since you threw up shone,<br/>all things you loved in vain.<br/><br/>One alone I smiled last kiss,<br/>watching the train go away,<br/>through the dirt of a glass,<br/>in a glance you were a fey,<br/><br/>I couldn't stand you to dull,<br/>but the rails cut off my eyes,<br/>the pain overcome my skull,<br/>who hasn't seen who cries,<br/><br/>and once again up to home,<br/>only managed to be alone,<br/><br/> how to lock up your brain,<br/> once the damage's done,<br/> since you threw up shone,<br/> all things you loved in vain.<br/><br/>I can even now remember,<br/>every step we took today,<br/>every moment seems an ember,<br/>but I know I am the pray,<br/><br/>afraid my sickle won't have,<br/>the blood that seems so red,<br/>I can't see it but I can give,<br/>since we were It can't be bad,<br/><br/>I'd tear open my own heart,<br/>if only I was turn to earth,<br/><br/>  how to lock up your brain,<br/>  once the damage's done,<br/>  since you threw up shone,<br/>  all things you loved in vain.<br/><br/>I can't succeed in hiding,<br/>there's no one to hide from,<br/>I can't succeed in dying,<br/>as I can't forget my home,<br/><br/>too many things I care about,<br/>lots of things do bind my arms,<br/>my brain alone is free to shout,<br/>you are the one who charms,<br/><br/>and I can't do what I am to,<br/>since we are built to be you,<br/><br/>   how to lock up your brain,<br/>   once the damage's done,<br/>   since you threw up shone,<br/>   all things you loved in vain,<br/><br/>    once the damage's done,<br/>    since you threw up shone,<br/>    all things you loved in vain,<br/><br/>    once the damage's done,<br/>    since you threw up shone,<br/>    all things you loved in vain,<br/><br/>    once the damage's done,<br/>    since you threw up shone,<br/>    all things you loved in vain.
