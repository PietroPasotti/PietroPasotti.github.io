Shall you listen,<br/>when you may hear,<br/>I'd tear apart my fear,<br/>to eat the glisten<br/><br/>you offer me everyday,<br/>I'd overcome my conscience,<br/>to let you with me once<br/>see the soft dreamy<br/><br/>world you gave me.<br/><br/>You know me<br/>enough to see,<br/>when I speak<br/>with body or soul,<br/>when my shame brings break,<br/>as I deal with my own.<br/><br/>Shall you answer,<br/>as I ask things no one can know?<br/>Shall you answer,<br/>as I say things from another world?
