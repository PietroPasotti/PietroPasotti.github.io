The lot of pain it's all around,<br/>make me miss what I have found,<br/>make me feel as I were alone,<br/>which can't be we're the one,<br/><br/>and the only way for us to find,<br/>what we have left behind,<br/>is to behead the sadness's worm,<br/>then let me fill till I'm my form.<br/><br/>So this is life...
