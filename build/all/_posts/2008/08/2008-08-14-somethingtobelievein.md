Give me something to believe,<br/>live only to see me thrive,<br/>achieve some pain to leave,<br/><br/>then let sometimes me<br/>hug you and then fall<br/>down, just to see your rise,<br/><br/>it seems I'm wise,<br/>so simply give it all<br/>and listen, I wish you and me.<br/><br/>I'd love to see with child's eye,<br/>once again the face of things,<br/>I may be ready for a try,<br/><br/>'cause we deserve more than a way,<br/>at least I'd give you a sky,<br/>which can't be full of sins.<br/><br/>And like a thunder then<br/>will seem the place I saw,<br/>another way to hear the when,<br/><br/>another brick to be made in raw,<br/>and I know I think you can,<br/>and you will, even though<br/><br/>the castle is set to fall,<br/>in the end is really thicker,<br/>and if the wind can take it down,<br/><br/>well maybe it's you who shown,<br/>we made our eyes someone else's,<br/>and so we've run into our wall.
