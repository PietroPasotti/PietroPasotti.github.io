Did you scream enough<br/>to make her laugh,<br/>or the fists you threw<br/>were to make her low,<br/>were her soul to kick,<br/>who's her home's brick?<br/><br/>The sun's arising<br/>for her eyes crying,<br/>and the moon's too smiling,<br/>for her black face aching.<br/><br/>Look behind you and watch her face,<br/>see her pain in your fight embrace,<br/>open your arms and watch through,<br/>eat the sorrow because of you.<br/><br/>What's the freedom beyond your violence,<br/>who's wrong behind your heart fence?
