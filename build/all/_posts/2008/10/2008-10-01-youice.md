I think at you,<br/>we search your eyes,<br/>we could find a place of ice,<br/>but we see the light is true,<br/>if the delight looks like the sky,<br/>when the world is seem so dry,<br/><br/>we could live before the down,<br/>we can get the cold in drown,<br/>we may see it's you in us,<br/>though we see it's not because<br/><br/>we have been to you so much,<br/>if you like we keep in touch,<br/>if you're good as seem to be,<br/>think we are still you and me,<br/><br/>think it is a piece of story,<br/>think the fable and it's merry,<br/>look my eyes,<br/>and think I'm ice.<br/><br/>Just be leap to get the high,<br/>just be thunder to make cry,<br/>unable to fix even a toy,<br/>just a man or just a boy,<br/><br/>do you still remember it,<br/>the white colour of the moon,<br/>or have you forgotten,<br/>the union of daemon?<br/><br/>I think at you,<br/>you look like me,<br/>somehow this was so good,<br/>somewhen it has been bad,<br/>please please please<br/>don't leave me this,<br/><br/>please please please<br/>don't make me this,<br/><br/>it has been so we can fly,<br/>once again to touch the sky,<br/><br/>once again to see the blind,<br/>just a man or just a boy,<br/>you will have to keep in mind,<br/>that our life is not a toy.
