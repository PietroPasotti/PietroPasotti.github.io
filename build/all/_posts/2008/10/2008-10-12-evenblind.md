Look at this star,<br/>it's not that far,<br/>it might be the glow<br/>we're about to show,<br/><br/>enlighten your face<br/>with stars' embrace,<br/>look for a murder<br/>and make you wonder,<br/><br/>if it's right it all,<br/>pick the phone and call,<br/><br/>your last friend of days,<br/>the one who's not so ice,<br/><br/>the one who will see you,<br/>even blind will see it thru.<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">To Anikina...</span>
