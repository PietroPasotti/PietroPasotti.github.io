You please, raise your head<br/>look up, turn around<br/>here I am, lost and found<br/>here I am, look at me<br/>look at what I think could be<br/><br/>but the air flows by<br/>and so do you, like wind between my fingers<br/>the tighter I hold<br/>the stronger you flow<br/>and there is no way any love could I show<br/>and so not disturbed, not aware still you blow.
