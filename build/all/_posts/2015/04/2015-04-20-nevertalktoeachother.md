Fresh water<br/>dry breeze<br/>between you and you I squeeze<br/>breathing in I bubble up<br/>make a tiny house to live<br/>like a shell or a tortoise<br/>or the much less noble snail<br/>I enjoy looking at this<br/>and in muddy waters sail.<br/><br/>Oh that moves<br/>maybe I could talk to you<br/>or you could talk to me<br/>perhaps it's true<br/>but that will never be.
