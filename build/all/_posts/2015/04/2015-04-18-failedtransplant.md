I turn to you<br/>empty-handed<br/>open-hearted<br/>the transplant didn't go well<br/>the cut is open<br/>and burns like hell<br/>nothing was forgiven<br/>I hope this rings a bell.<br/><br/>I've seen many things I love<br/>my fantasy is replete<br/>but peaceful still I'm not<br/>and far from being complete.
