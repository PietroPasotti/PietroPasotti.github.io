I finally have found<br/>a beautiful place to sit around<br/>a place to feel the mellow caress<br/>of something close to loneliness<br/><br/>my eyes are blank like starless nights<br/>my gaze won't dive from reckless heights<br/>I'm here to rest,<br/>and now, caressed<br/>I wander peacefully in delight.<br/><br/>Too long it takes<br/>for a word to come to be<br/>for a flower to smile in bloom<br/>ablaze no longer through sleepless nights<br/>awaiting the morning<br/>to pay back lust with doom.
