I'm here to remember<br/>building monuments to an<br/>ancient morning glory<br/>letting myself be shaped<br/>by the force of an unwilling tide<br/><br/>I'm here to be remembered<br/>a monument to my own pride<br/>carved out of hopes<br/>and of despairs, on the other side<br/><br/>my skin is turning to a marble plating<br/>hopeless protection for an unknown evil<br/>and a man, behind all that<br/>that is still however fading.
