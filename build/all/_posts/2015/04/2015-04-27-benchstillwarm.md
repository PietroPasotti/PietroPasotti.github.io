There used to be something sitting next to me<br/>day and night all the time its purple lips all mine<br/>it used to remind me how I was alive<br/>night and day in my name its kiss made me divine<br/><br/>sitting next to me there was probably someone<br/>day and night aside my throne<br/>now it's gone<br/>I'm alone.<br/><br/>There used to be a quiet silence<br/>now there's noise.
