The tree stands there<br/>the leaves are still<br/>but I swing another way<br/>and forever on I will<br/><br/>gravity doesn't work the same<br/>for all of us<br/>some forces strike us differently<br/>depending on how we feel<br/>today it flows on laterally<br/>and forever on it will<br/><br/>I feel close to the horizon<br/>in some very peculiar way<br/>we alone see things in this unique perspective<br/>or so we like to say<br/><br/>but things keep falling the old way<br/>and there's nowhere we could fall<br/>catch the stars as they move by<br/>forever on we will.
