Covered in unsettling dust<br/>surrounded by fiery beasts<br/>I drank the water of this river<br/>on which my murderer still feasts<br/><br/>I have fallen here asleep<br/>as if nothing had begun<br/>without paying attention<br/>to a fairy with a shotgun.<br/><br/>All mistakes forgiven<br/>morbid fogs encase my misery<br/>a ghost in a closet<br/>uncloaks my every mystery<br/><br/>now I'm at your feet<br/>deeply buried in cold water<br/>with this peace and insane silence<br/>I can wait for the next never.<br/><br/>
