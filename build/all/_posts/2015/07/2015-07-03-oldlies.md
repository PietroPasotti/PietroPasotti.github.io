All I'm saying to you<br/>I already said to myself<br/><br/>I try to be ready<br/>but no occasion will come<br/>always<br/>a stranger<br/>wherever I decide to go<br/><br/>one day we will be old enough<br/>to have this conversation without crying<br/>I just hope I'll never lie to you<br/>as I rarely feel like lying.
