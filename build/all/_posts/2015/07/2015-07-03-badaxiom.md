I'll give up dreaming<br/>at some point<br/>my skin shimmers<br/>with the tones of bronze<br/>no longer it is true<br/>what was once<br/><br/>I'd love to see you again<br/>the same way we were used to<br/>I shall give up dreaming<br/>at some point.<br/><br/>Nowhere between me and you<br/>there is a quiet place<br/>for us to see each other<br/><br/>there's like a bad axiom<br/>breaking up our logic<br/>sometimes I feel we're incomplete<br/>- that's the sad moments -<br/>sometimes I know there should be nothing<br/>- that's the moments of truth.
