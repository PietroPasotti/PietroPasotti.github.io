Sea, behold<br/>the shell is broken<br/>the land stands stolen<br/>we drift away<br/>from one another<br/>we hide ourselves<br/>from the fiery nature<br/>she might change our minds<br/>and burn away our shelter<br/><br/>grand ocean, behold<br/>it is like you have been told<br/>yes we are freezing<br/>but you are cold<br/>yet you keep moving<br/>while we unfold<br/><br/>comet hair and deep space eyes<br/>will not come as a surprise<br/>mother nature will behold<br/>my heart so long has rolled<br/><br/>I can no longer feel my hands, my dear<br/>I no longer feel my feet<br/>I can no longer feel my fear <br/>mid-air, somewhere, years from now again we'll meet.<br/><br/>
