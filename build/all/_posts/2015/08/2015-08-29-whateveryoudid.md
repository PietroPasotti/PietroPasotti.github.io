Yet no black spot in the sky<br/>where have all the birds gone?<br/>Where are the crows nesting<br/>and the eagles feasting<br/>the dark thoughts<br/>have wandered away<br/>out of simple stochastic boredom<br/>the particles are rearranging<br/>in a much more favourable way<br/><br/>what did you do for me?<br/>did you beg, did you pray?<br/>Whatever it was, you had me all along.
