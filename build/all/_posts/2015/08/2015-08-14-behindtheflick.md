Behind that little flick on your head<br/>there's a nightmare of thoughts<br/>pushing their way<br/>around you, towards me<br/>covered in doubts<br/>about what is and what may<br/><br/>I'll point to your face a thousand ways<br/>hoping one will pierce you through<br/>bend over your heart<br/>and get straight to you.<br/><br/>A different day will fall and rise<br/>when I have little more to say<br/>and like a tiny spot of dirt in the water<br/>I'll wait for you to flow away.
