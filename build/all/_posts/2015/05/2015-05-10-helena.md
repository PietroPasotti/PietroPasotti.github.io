It's either now or never<br/>don't think<br/>you would never stop<br/>don't smile so much<br/>I will soon turn transparent<br/>feather eyelids flap no more<br/>let me be washed ashore<br/>coral hands and oyster nails<br/>dark blue eyes replace my own<br/>what am I, curse or crown<br/><br/>if I'm going to make you a princess<br/>what may come<br/>will come what may,<br/>back to you<br/>I will walk that way.
