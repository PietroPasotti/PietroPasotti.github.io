So much time has passed<br/>this little left will never do<br/>widening mouths and clocks<br/>suggest and swallow<br/>any possible outcome<br/><br/>light blades cut through the curtains<br/>trim my patience with greatest care<br/>up in the air<br/>I'll shoot my gaze<br/>consciously waiting for it to pay back<br/><br/>unknown my fate<br/>with anger, retaliate<br/><br/>now a hazy feeling<br/>slowly breaking in<br/>slowly getting through<br/>a day will come where you<br/><br/>realize<br/>the reason behind my eyes<br/>the colour of their shade<br/>the lust that they conceal<br/>the love of which they're made.
