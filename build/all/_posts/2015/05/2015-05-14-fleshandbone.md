Is there something I'm allowed to say<br/>to have you here on my fingertips<br/>is there anything you would accept<br/>as a fair price for a stroke o' lips<br/><br/>is this the way we get to know<br/>how do we interleave our ways<br/>with delicate flowers and hollow<br/>despair, we're caught in the maze<br/><br/>amazed and confused,<br/>caught and excluded<br/>first seen and then lost<br/>then what is the cost<br/><br/>so is there something I'm free to give<br/>to let grow up and fly alone<br/>so is there anything behind this aether<br/>'cause now I need some flesh and bone.
