I know how it feels like<br/>it looks like I do<br/>it may not be as quiet<br/>but it is quiet too<br/>nothing beyond comprehension<br/>but I can't help with it<br/>anybody with a steady mind<br/>will provide a perfect fit.<br/><br/>Another day on Saturn<br/>elapsed without a sound<br/>another day of searching<br/>and nothing has been found<br/><br/>murder it once more<br/>and you shall then prevail<br/>find me on the seashore<br/>together we'll set sail.
