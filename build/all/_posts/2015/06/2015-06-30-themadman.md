Like a never-sleeping nerve<br/>everything I observe<br/><br/>the world is ripe with crazy people<br/>but if you ever set your eyes upon<br/>someone crazier than I am<br/>may god strike me with a lightning<br/>if I'll give a single damn<br/><br/>I am not here to argue<br/>I am not here to stand or fall<br/>in fact, I'm not even here at all.
