I will pick up this daisy<br/>and cover it in glass<br/>so that no energy discharge<br/>may trigger loss of mass<br/><br/>I will pick this very flower<br/>and as everything I do<br/>I'll pack it nicely in a ribbon<br/>and give it back to you.<br/><br/>Somehow you always seem<br/>to deserve all that I'm worth<br/>and although your value's fair<br/>it seems of a different sort<br/><br/>now that we've come out<br/>out of the same egg<br/>we can cry together<br/>and lay ourselves aside<br/><br/>we can sleep together<br/>and even share a dream or two<br/>up to the point where every dream<br/>will end up to belong to you<br/><br/>now, that moment come and gone<br/>sit down and think<br/>that's how I'm made<br/>shifting as you are<br/>if there ever is complain<br/>you could just focus for a moment<br/>and turn to another shade.
