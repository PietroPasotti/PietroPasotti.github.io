It's one of those night<br/>where I mean everything I say<br/>I can't really feel my limbs<br/>my head is full of fluffy thoughts<br/>my breathing space is clear<br/>my window open<br/>my places, here<br/><br/>my simptoms have gone<br/>once more we shall shine<br/>will you take my hand<br/>to the end of the line.<br/><br/>It's one of those moments<br/>where I can't feel anything anymore<br/>I could take a step and fall backwards<br/>without really caring<br/>where I don't want anything anymore<br/>an awkward silence<br/>weird enough to be said happy<br/>quiet enough to be said lonely<br/><br/>but somehow some things<br/>kick me off my shades<br/>and give me a ring of blades<br/>not to ever fall asleep again<br/><br/>I will dream of you one day<br/>and I already did<br/>together we will play<br/>some language games we never plaid.
