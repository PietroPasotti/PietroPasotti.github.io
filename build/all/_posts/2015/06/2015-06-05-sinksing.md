I should be somewhere<br/>crying alone<br/>singing to the tears<br/>my pains and fears<br/><br/>I should be secluded<br/>silenced, defused<br/>but I am going to hurt<br/>many more people in the future<br/><br/>I got some problem<br/>I can't believe<br/>everyone feels like this<br/>sometimes<br/><br/>this is not the way to go<br/>I think<br/>filling my mouth with<br/>rumours and vice<br/>so lonely we sink.
