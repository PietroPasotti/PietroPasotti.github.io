A soundscape of my soul<br/>as dark as a black hole<br/>will send you back in life<br/>and chew you as you rise<br/><br/>another smile is a forbidden sunrise<br/>chained together like hope and regret<br/>hand in hand for its demise<br/>I will help the sun to set.<br/><br/>A long gone feeling like a sinking ship<br/>has its captain still on board<br/><br/>if its orders had been heard<br/>less thirsty would have been the whip.
