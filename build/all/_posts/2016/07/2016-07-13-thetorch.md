There was a time when he was old<br/>the night had fallen sharp and cold<br/>she saw him there against the dying blue<br/>and she realised he'd fallen too<br/><br/>out of nowhere the lighting came<br/>fluting symphonies of rain<br/>through him it ran and where it hit<br/>a fiery fire it sudden lit<br/><br/>she ran and hid under her porch<br/>as she heard crackling the new torch<br/>because while he was good and gone<br/>she didn't feel at all immune.
