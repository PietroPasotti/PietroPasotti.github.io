The victim will feel guilty<br/>imagine then the culprit<br/>who wishes to confess<br/>this is a call: distress<br/><br/>glorify my painful muses<br/>to symbols of emotion<br/>a call that suffers and amuses<br/>tears and laughter - more commotion<br/><br/>and in this desert I see him<br/>an angel of soap<br/>a knight of no order<br/>ready to kill at a simple whim<br/>ready to sacrifice his horde<br/>just because he's got a sword.<br/><br/>A daemon of water has appeared to me<br/>he offered me gold that I didn't take<br/>he offered an oath he wouldn't break<br/>and that I took because I see<br/><br/>how the world moves 'round in tidal spins<br/>and the sun and moon are evil twins.
