I have a bad feeling<br/>I have the gift of bad prescience<br/>woo storms on my way I see<br/>which means woo coming to me<br/><br/>I have a sense of proving right<br/>the worst predictions and feelings<br/>of giving ill advice<br/>and clumsy misspelled readings<br/><br/>and telling you're wrong<br/>when you are not<br/>convincing you that this or that<br/>is not worth a single shot<br/><br/>I could go on for days<br/>like a blind man thinks he sees<br/>describes to an unwilling guest<br/>what is honey for his bees<br/><br/>I could go on for weeks<br/>if life weren't so short<br/>and said amount of ugly speech<br/>weren't uglier than its worth<br/><br/>as we fall to my last prophecy<br/>we are reminded to be scared<br/>and rise our arms to cry for help<br/>so falling will catch us unprepared.
