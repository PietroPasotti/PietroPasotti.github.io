Crowded as they stand<br/>these houses close on me<br/>and on the water<br/><br/>humbled by the tide<br/>this time<br/>I won't let go of me<br/><br/>there is a great secret<br/>all around our<br/>colour dreams<br/><br/>I had a full-on reality<br/>check, tonight<br/>she said with a foreign accent<br/><br/>he came flying from<br/>a nearby sun<br/>but couldn't remember why<br/><br/>shaken as we go<br/>may we be forgiven<br/>and reminded that we know.<br/><br/>
