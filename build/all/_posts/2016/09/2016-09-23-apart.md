Now I don't remember<br/>not a thing, not one<br/>I spend my time oblivious<br/>where are you?<br/>Who's you?<br/>Who's who?<br/><br/>Anyone would do<br/>this is my level of desperation<br/>but what we've found<br/>cannot be lost<br/>a unique chance<br/>we had to throw away<br/>we like to think:<br/>not us, but they<br/>still our feet took us apart<br/>our actions spoke aloud<br/>aloud enough<br/>the truth is rough<br/><br/>not a finger was moved<br/>but a tear was shed<br/>no amount of pain<br/>could have changed a thing<br/>yet not even my mistake<br/>what then I cried<br/>could sing.
