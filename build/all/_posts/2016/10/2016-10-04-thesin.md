The lights are out<br/>we are all alone, my love<br/>we are all alone and you<br/>you're the only one left alive<br/><br/>we're rising through old ashes<br/>and with nothing to rebuild<br/>we are told to rise and walk<br/>without sword and without shield<br/><br/>the time is up<br/>we'll have to make a move<br/>we'll have to make a choice<br/>that can never be undone<br/>but what if we were wrong<br/>what if we were gone<br/>this leaves me without voice<br/>leaves you without love<br/>leaves us without breath<br/>oh if only we were strong.<br/><br/>The mysteries unwound<br/>the hunt may now begin<br/>run ahead, my friend<br/>for I'm about to sin.
