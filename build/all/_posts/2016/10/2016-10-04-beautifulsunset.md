Look at this beautiful sunset<br/>covered in clouds<br/>enhance its mystery<br/>my thoughts make it<br/>a beautiful suspect<br/>covered in admiration<br/>taste my misbehaviour<br/>then fly to me, my saviour<br/>and release me of my pain<br/><br/>and right when I can take no more<br/>it looks like an angel what I'm hoping for<br/>locked inside the prison of my very home<br/>the suspect arises - it's never going to come<br/><br/>so look at this beautiful sunset<br/>one shadow at a time<br/>is enough to smash through me<br/>but a forest, I will say<br/>would kill me right away.
