This is how to break a silence<br/>I don't know, is it a crime?<br/>If this silence can't be broken<br/>are we looking for a blame?<br/>Sometimes waste<br/>is more precious than a gift<br/>only after the disposal<br/>the thin surface of a draft<br/>becomes something worth approval<br/>as a caress falling soft.<br/><br/>Ho we should have paid attention<br/>ho we should have looked more straight<br/>the symptoms have long overgrown the ache<br/>my body starts to shake<br/>my mouth will not recover<br/>my lips will be sealed closer<br/>where were you?<br/><br/>Sealed minds sealed bodies<br/>closed eyes and sad faces<br/>no more the joy shall breed<br/>on this field we spread our seed<br/>long ago, so long ago<br/>it was a sunny Spring<br/>now I sit on a small swing<br/>when the bees just start to sting<br/>maybe's time to come closer,<br/>come closer.
