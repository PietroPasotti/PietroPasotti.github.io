Ahey, my friend<br/>wher you going - I don't know<br/>what you doing - I don't know<br/>what you saying - I don't say<br/>anything I utter, hits the soil like pouring rain.<br/><br/>Chill.<br/>The whispers moving the windmills<br/>the shimmering leaves move lazily<br/>the setting sun shrinks over me<br/>the whole universe bathes in dim light<br/>more and more stars get in sight<br/>all my memories I rewind<br/>to show to you my shrinking body;<br/><br/>soon you won't read into my eyes - anymore<br/>soon you won't read into my tattoos - anymore<br/>I run after the sun and dive the highest cliffs<br/>the sea gets nearer and nearer<br/>the waves hive faster and faster<br/>humming caves enjoy the tide<br/>water explosions cheer my coming into view<br/><br/>a beautiful bird<br/>a beautiful bird<br/>waves his wing in histery<br/>weaves his threads into the fabric of the clouds<br/>I shrink some more and hold tightly<br/>to my breath<br/>to my breath.<br/><br/>We will run out of water<br/>run out of sea<br/>the weight of thousand clouds<br/>is heavying over me<br/><br/>I finally fall asleep<br/>and lie over the sea.
