Immense azure planets<br/>collide in silent space<br/>no human ear will ever know<br/>which is the tone in which that blow<br/>runs across the dark black ocean<br/>shuffling stars like a full on tide<br/>growing greater, growing wide<br/><br/>my eyes will never see<br/>your ears will never know<br/>where the dark black tides go crushing<br/>the yellow dots who forgot to glow.
