Sometimes the clouds blend over me<br/>on the same wavelength of irony<br/>I let the soil pour over my head<br/>and the sour water soak my own bed<br/><br/>we can't help<br/>the truth are closed<br/>under every assumption<br/>you could ever make<br/><br/>from falsum follows everything<br/>and the world is a huge big counterfactual<br/>and so let's stop talking strange<br/>let's go take a beer, sneak a fuck<br/><br/>and the old world take from its back<br/>and all will have turned suddenly<br/>to a far more similar<br/>shade of me.
