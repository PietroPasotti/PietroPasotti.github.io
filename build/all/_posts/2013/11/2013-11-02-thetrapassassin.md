I see you are caught into the trap<br/>of seeing in me a soul I'm not<br/>to think I'm good only because<br/>the baby face lets you suppose;<br/><br/>I wish the man not unlike me<br/>had more the face of assassin<br/>instead of looking like a mist<br/>the cloud of fairies I have missed;<br/><br/>I see I'm caught into the trap<br/>of looking like a man I'm not<br/>of looking fast as light and brave<br/>because of how I don't behave<br/><br/>instead of punching my way through<br/>ten meters down below a grave;<br/><br/>it seems you're facing the slippery knot<br/>of thinking I'm the one I'm not<br/>because weird chains of consequences<br/>have tied my image of absence<br/><br/>to a monolithic paradigm of truth<br/>where lies unburied the crying youth<br/>and all the skies I failed to be<br/>for those I swore to set once free.<br/><br/>It seems you're caught into the trap<br/>of seeing in me a soul I'm not,<br/>I will send you an assassin<br/>to chase you out of your own dream<br/><br/>because the man you're looking for<br/>is not a man I'm anymore<br/><br/>it seems you're caught into the trap<br/>of thinking I'm a man who I am not<br/>and I'll send you my assassin<br/>who once killed you, will then kill me.
