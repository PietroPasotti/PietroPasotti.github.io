You were hit by a dead star<br/>you were<br/>you are<br/>pushed,<br/>just a little bit more,<br/>far.<br/><br/>You've been hit quick<br/>and silently<br/>by some ghosts of every me<br/><br/>the windmills keep rolling<br/>my skin as a translucent sail or wing<br/>swirling like a top<br/>in the air of a cold spring.<br/><br/>The recoil has hit me too<br/>and I'm pushed hard within you<br/><br/>no strenghts are involved<br/>space stretches<br/>tensor vectors and pale arrows<br/>denote per each word a pathway towards the empty infinite,<br/>no balance can be lost<br/>no active wounds have been carved<br/>all of the pain remains enclosed<br/>like a ghost remaining hidden<br/>like a ghost being undisclosed<br/>in the within<br/>as in the space<br/>there's very much room, to hide in.<br/><br/>In this mad lonely double<br/>cepheids stay wrapped in a cloud of mistery<br/>right what I needed<br/>right where I needed<br/>a nebula must be sinking me unaware<br/>and in thin space<br/>nobody will care,<br/><br/>nobody will care.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>Follows a moment of silence.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>Inside a blue car<br/>floating seamlessly in a hidden folding of a far star's sky<br/>we throw in the third gear<br/>and push a little bit further<br/>the boundaries of madness<br/><br/>and deep inside of me<br/>will grow a galaxy<br/>and deep inside of you<br/>the past sky will stay blue<br/><br/>I hope the river is still there<br/>and the branches scrape its back<br/>and I believe you do also<br/>somewhere we come from<br/>somewhere will we go.
