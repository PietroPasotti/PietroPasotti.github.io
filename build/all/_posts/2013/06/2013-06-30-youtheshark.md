A static impossibility<br/>twists on air<br/>straight above me<br/><br/>lock a twilight galaxy<br/>in a box of wooden dark<br/>crossing oceans swim on thee<br/>do not know there's you, the shark;<br/><br/>a grove of pale men<br/>hides in the bush<br/>around them wolves<br/>every now and then<br/><br/>howl their sad unhappiness<br/><br/>there's no I can do,<br/>there's no I can do<br/>either for me or<br/>neither for you<br/><br/>I strike in the shade<br/>the colors I'm made<br/>the beasts that I kill<br/>as soon as they're still<br/>search for me with rotting eyes<br/>the look of the dead<br/>whose we foresee the envies<br/><br/>still will look on me<br/>on me hiding in the dark<br/>on you hiding after me<br/>because that's what is the shark.
