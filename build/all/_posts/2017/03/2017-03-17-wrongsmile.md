It gets more and more tiring<br/>to keep appearances up<br/>the mask is burning<br/>but still clinging on my face<br/>who will I be talking from<br/>once all this is over?<br/>will the light burn harder,<br/>as the turtle drops the cover?<br/>will even breathing hurt<br/>or will there even be another?<br/><br/>Dreaming of not being ashamed<br/>even a wrong smile<br/>carves the pain around your eyes<br/><br/>questioning the strength in your arms<br/>how much is left before we say goodbye<br/>maybe one more night<br/>perhaps not even so little.
