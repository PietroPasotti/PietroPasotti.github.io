Like a thunder, the river<br/>cut through the branches<br/>revealing rays of light<br/>uncovering a hidden secret<br/>which I'm not spelling out for you.<br/>I will consume this latency<br/>let it soothe my fears<br/>and then talk to you again<br/>my dear, take you someplace far<br/>and bring you back in tears.<br/>Uncharted waist-deep oceans<br/>lie between you and me<br/>the hope we feel is the love we need<br/>ashamed of every inner sigh<br/>we let go of when we are unseen<br/>hoping we will go unnoticed<br/>along with the evil we don't mean.<br/>A host of clouds is changing form<br/>a wave of wind is raining harm,<br/>at the other end of the spectrum<br/>a tireless ghost reminds me<br/>of the little things we did<br/>when our names used to be known<br/>fairy tales were sung and told<br/>and everywhere were flowers grown<br/>even though it was so cold.
