Hello, how are you<br/>are you willing to not be invincible<br/>or the ways you bend while<br/>trying to become invisible<br/>are beginning to fight back<br/>refusing to stay malleable<br/>white corners turning black<br/>the cracks are still irreparable<br/><br/>this castle is closing in on me<br/>these ruins have served their destinies<br/>time to migrate and cross the sea<br/>the sea of solitude, the sea of memories<br/>to ride a wave or hide beneath<br/>hope it leads to different histories<br/>to cling on with claws and teeth<br/>as sharp and tight as my fear is.<br/><br/>
