Arms lie tense<br/>reduction, defense<br/>shivers run around<br/>a stray hound<br/>an evil beast, insatiable<br/>sucks my air out of my lungs<br/>chews my teeth out of my gum<br/>rapid fire shadow plays<br/>confuse me<br/>delude me<br/>how many times will I have to count my fingers<br/>I never get to learn my fears<br/>they hide themselves in numbers<br/>and talk to me in tears<br/>no safe place, no way out<br/>my ground I pace<br/>my skies I scout<br/>my head I blow out and around<br/>exposing shames and hissing thoughts<br/>the further I look<br/>the emptier I find myself inside<br/>the shoulders I carry<br/>bend beneath their weight<br/>not even my home is safe,<br/>not even my home.
