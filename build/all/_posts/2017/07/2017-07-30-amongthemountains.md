I want to live among the mountains<br/>in a peaceful valley where the evening sun<br/>can hide and seek<br/>between the snowy peaks;<br/><br/>I may want to die on a mountain top<br/>and rest forever under a stone<br/>as heavy as the soul<br/>I had to carry along in life.<br/><br/>May my life have been a path<br/>for those of you who walked along<br/>a path which simply disappears<br/>once you've walked it to the end.<br/><br/>May my death come as a sunset<br/>and vanish rapidly behind<br/>the mountains where I hid myself<br/>leaving traces hard to find.<br/><br/>I was raised among the glaciers<br/>which bend and crack under the weight of the sun<br/>I squeezed my whole existence through heavy shadows<br/>it's time I burn with blinding light<br/><br/>I will fall atop the horizon<br/>where the night shall find me easily<br/>carry me away and far<br/>and finally turn me into a star.
