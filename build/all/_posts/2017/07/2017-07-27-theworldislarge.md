The maps are wider every day<br/>as the oceans overflow;<br/>the world's edges blow away<br/>everything there is to blow<br/><br/>the world's in fact an infinite line<br/>grabbing on our feet<br/>like a very nasty vine<br/><br/>there's so much space<br/>we can hear each other<br/>only when our hands<br/>are holding one another.<br/><br/>Yet<br/>the air is closing in.
