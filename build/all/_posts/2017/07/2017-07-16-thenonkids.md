Where the dice is cast and the story told<br/>the children sit on a floor ice-cold,<br/>they wait and wait for supper time<br/>in silence for they weren't told to whine<br/><br/>their rebellious hair concealed within<br/>their big gray hats with other sin,<br/>love letters, photos, locks of hair<br/>that got caught up under that chair<br/><br/>where all those kids, so they told me<br/>all too soon, kids ceased to be.
