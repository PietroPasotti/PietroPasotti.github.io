In these places<br/>other ages<br/>throw their arms around our necks<br/>fold their fingers in their hands<br/><br/>my head is shaking angry thoughts<br/>fistfuls of violence squeeze the life out of each other;<br/>fall the leaves around this aura<br/><br/>a low light like an evening sun<br/>scared, shies away like a guilty dog<br/>and chased by those thoughts<br/>I approach the raging river<br/>surrender to the punishing water<br/>I had lots to live<br/>but now the time is over.
