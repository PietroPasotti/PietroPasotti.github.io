By the mountain lake I sit<br/>with my feet the water touch,<br/>with my eyes I long the trees<br/>by the brightest silence lit<br/><br/>by the mountain lake I sleep,<br/>as if protected by the stones,<br/>no more skin around my bones<br/>by the extinguished fire I weep<br/><br/>by the mountain lake I rest<br/>at last a soothing night of quiet<br/>the longest time I ever slept<br/>to not forget the time I lost<br/><br/>by the mountain lake I rot<br/>as the birds construct their nest<br/>between the wounds inside my chest<br/>for all the times that I could not<br/><br/>move along the lines<br/>my life had laid for me<br/>or rhyme along the rhymes<br/>that could have set me free.
