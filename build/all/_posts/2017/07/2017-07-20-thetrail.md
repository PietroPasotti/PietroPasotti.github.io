As I play the game<br/>the shifting fields<br/>move their sands<br/>around my feet<br/><br/>we shiver if<br/>we look around<br/>holding tight<br/>to what we found<br/><br/>what did we fine<br/>that I don't know,<br/>a trail of footprints<br/>left in the snow<br/><br/>a trail we chose<br/>because it's late<br/>and we may lose<br/>at the hands of fate.<br/><br/>Beneath the snow<br/>still hides the sand<br/>its hidden glow<br/>meets avid hand<br/><br/>the tracks are old<br/>and all too soon<br/>the trail is cold<br/>and I go loon<br/><br/>hey, we met<br/>by chance alone<br/>and so we let<br/>our minds be gone<br/><br/>we drink and laugh<br/>our thoughts away<br/>you won't believe<br/>as wouldn't they<br/><br/>but our eyes meet<br/>and glimpse truth<br/>and bits of love<br/>and proper youth<br/><br/>maybe we can have<br/>a view over that sea<br/>or talk alone for days<br/>and hide where we can't see<br/><br/>in way too many ways<br/>things can't go really wrong<br/>so I'll think of you the way I like<br/>and that thought will make me strong.<br/><i><br/></i><i>To Marlene...</i>
