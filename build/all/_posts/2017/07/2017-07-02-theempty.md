I'm staring at you<br/>with those eyes full of nothing<br/>and it's all I got<br/>those final steps<br/>echo down the spine<br/>icing like a brine<br/>sobbing like a dream<br/>here it is my scream<br/><br/>he had me waiting<br/>or didn't I want to hear?<br/>is it excitement or is it fear<br/><br/>all these monsters<br/>are waiting for me<br/>the people know<br/>my face is shouting how doomed I am<br/>deep memories keep surfacing<br/><br/>and I drown them like they're not tomorrow<br/>like their name alone<br/>did not evoke my sorrow<br/><br/>astonish me with a spontaneous smile<br/>cripple my last dreams<br/>like white canes in the Nile<br/>when the forgiving tide<br/>washes all away.
