Tied into the same spot<br/>by a thin, invisible thread<br/>bent, and wound up feet to head<br/>in a little lovely knot<br/><br/>imposes meaning over a shredded space<br/>links our hearts like a golden lace<br/>watch us as we do<br/>that which ancient beings desire<br/>flows and animates our bones<br/>like spark and flames infuse a rhythm in fire.
