Breathe out<br/>you're stuck in a loop<br/>you're caught in a web<br/>a deception, a phobia<br/><br/>or what else it is we're made of.<br/><br/>A great paralysing fear<br/>rises with the sun<br/>filling the horison<br/>with red reflection and nostalgia.<br/><br/>We're just not built for this kind of pain<br/>I believe, it drives us crazy<br/>but moves our moons<br/>too long we've stared at the sky<br/>without daring to venture<br/>on the other side of our gardens<br/>and now there we are<br/>still stuck in a loop<br/>what a beautiful metaphor.
