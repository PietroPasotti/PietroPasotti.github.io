I've been through eight hells<br/>before falling right here<br/>so I'll search for my shells<br/>for yet a little longer,<br/><br/>search within my fingers,<br/>you, sink within my soul<br/>while a thousand flying singers<br/>flies into the sea.<br/><br/>This landscape is awaiting<br/>once uninhabitable lands<br/>lie ripening and growing<br/>upon themselves, upon the spoils<br/><br/>left behind by earlier hells<br/>and the wreckage of the people<br/>shall still dance on broken bells<br/>just like I used to do.<br/><i><br/></i><i>To Marlene...</i>
