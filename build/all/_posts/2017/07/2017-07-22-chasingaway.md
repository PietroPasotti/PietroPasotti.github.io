Don't chase anything away<br/>while the night is young<br/>we can still be free<br/>so new, so full, so beautiful<br/>intensity washes away<br/>leaving traces of a thought<br/>whispering into your ear<br/>words that went unspoken.<br/><br/>Am I simply broken<br/>what are we really up to?<br/>We're trusting one another<br/>to live up to the word;<br/>am I writing this to you?<br/>And if not, to who?<br/><br/>Agitate my waters<br/>once more and then for all,<br/>may we be forgiven<br/>if we rise, and if we fall.
