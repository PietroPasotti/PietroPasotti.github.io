May this water wash me away<br/>shroud me in its icy fingers,<br/>hide me under muddy covers,<br/>may the river carry me away,<br/>away.<br/><br/>May this morning evening air<br/>soothe my burning morning bones,<br/>bare the trees and lift the stones<br/>that hide my misery in despair,<br/>may the water carry me away,<br/>away.<br/><br/>May the rocks under my feet<br/>slip away and swallow me down<br/>and a devil with a burning crown<br/>visit me while I'm asleep<br/>tonight my debt of blood I'll pay<br/>may the river wash me away,<br/>away.<br/><br/>May the trees stretch from the riversides<br/>and lift me up like a butterfly,<br/>and crush me down before I fail to try<br/>or give up to everchanging tides<br/>but above all, may the river, may<br/>wash the rest of me away,<br/>away.
