A twist of the rope<br/>a deep breath of hope<br/>a sea of voices<br/>and a lonely boat<br/><br/>upon that landscape<br/>we all fall<br/>we fail, we crumble,<br/>don't we all<br/><br/>a miracle before my eyes<br/>unfolds<br/>like a silver hand<br/>like my soul carved in the sand<br/><br/>I'm just waiting for my wave<br/>don't you know I am?<br/>we're all in the same sea<br/>but every cloud a ram was blown.
