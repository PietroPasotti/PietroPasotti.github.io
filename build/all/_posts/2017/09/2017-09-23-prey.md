I don't know what you know<br/>I don't see what you see<br/>can you say the same<br/>about me?<br/><br/>I feel observed<br/>your eyes gaze away<br/>somehow always at me<br/>like some sort of a prey<br/><br/>Avenges my thoughts<br/>and the time I spent after you<br/>after places we couldn't go<br/>words we couldn't see<br/><br/>we were a thing, you know<br/>one of those who won't back down<br/>disappear without a warning<br/>wake up alone one morning<br/><br/>somehow your wolves<br/>won't leave me alone<br/>but the world evolves<br/>even when we're gone.
