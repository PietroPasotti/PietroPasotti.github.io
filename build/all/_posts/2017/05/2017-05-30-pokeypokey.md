Pokey pokey<br/>nearly ready<br/>to wiggle and pop<br/>like a soapy bubble<br/><br/>pokey pokey<br/>I learn to deflate more gently<br/>instead of exploding<br/>muffled and ashamed<br/><br/>pokey pokey<br/>with every little poke<br/>a little sound I make<br/>and a bit more I deflate<br/><br/>pokey pokey<br/>I'm not sorry for who I am<br/>don't be for who you are<br/>deflate gently before my eyes.
