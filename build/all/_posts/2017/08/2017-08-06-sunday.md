Today was Sunday<br/>but only in a very metaphorical sense<br/>today was a dark day<br/>and it was also quite intense.<br/><br/>I pierced the clouds<br/>then a cloud pierced me<br/>I lay bare on my back<br/>cornered by a melody<br/><br/>it told me what shouldn't be heard<br/>that it would always be this cold<br/>and there was no lesson to be learned<br/>this taught me what shoulnd't be told<br/><br/>today was a bad day<br/>it ended with a dead beginning<br/>like a funny dance before a swordplay<br/>that made my heart go spinning,<br/><br/>but wobbling like a top on its final turns<br/>somehow I stood my ground<br/>and vacillating like a distant sound<br/>I made this Sunday more intense.
