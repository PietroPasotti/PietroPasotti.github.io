I swear my promises I'll keep<br/>I just need some sleep<br/>I swear my word is always kept<br/>given a full night is slept<br/><br/>let me go, into the dark<br/>swallowed by a new dream<br/>fully loaded, like an ark<br/>on every river, creek and stream<br/><br/>I'll sail those waters like a king<br/>my icy crown, my frozen sword<br/>my glorious arm, my sacred ring<br/>a frigate sweeping through the fjord<br/><br/>oh, these lonely nights<br/>when I take my time to think<br/>of which pains and which delights<br/>will await me when I sink.
