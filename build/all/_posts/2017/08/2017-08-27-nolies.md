Don't lie to me<br/>your heart is mine<br/>I had your soul<br/>for a snack, the other day:<br/>I was hungry;<br/>don't take me as a question<br/>I'm not so many things<br/>I'm one of many others<br/>simple, simple beings<br/>don't lie to me however<br/>just don't lie to me<br/>it would prove unwise<br/>to think I cannot see<br/>inside what's mine to hold<br/>so just no lies<br/>do what you're told:<br/>don't lie to me.
