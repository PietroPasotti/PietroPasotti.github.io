A foggy blanket coats the valley<br/>choking the tips of the pine trees<br/>and the mountain like a galley<br/>rides the clouds of many seas<br/><br/>keep us safe, keep us warm<br/>sheathe away all light and thunder<br/>don't unleash on us the storm<br/>let us free to breathe and wander<br/><br/>may the lights of men give you<br/>a touch of magic coloured haze<br/>and may some moon shine through<br/>to let us feel her mighty gaze<br/><br/>morning winds now shake the land<br/>carrying scents of dew and hay<br/>but the mountains be moved can't<br/>so the sea must sail away.
