Like an old tome in a library<br/>I only attract readers<br/>that came looking for me<br/>I can only wait,<br/>carrying my dust<br/>like an elegant dress<br/>my worn pages<br/>like shiny make-up,<br/>pretending I like to sleep<br/>and that I'd never wake up,<br/>longing in fact<br/>the hand that may lift me<br/>and open me up<br/>towards the light<br/>like a paper moth.
