Here is my tale<br/>feel like reading?<br/>Here is my neck<br/>feel like kissing?<br/><br/>Another shapeless form<br/>left unfinished by my hands<br/>unexploited lands<br/>destroyed by one big storm<br/><br/>to what end<br/>- to what end ? -<br/>do we let this carve our eyes out<br/>nobody will give us a thing<br/>we take on this pain willfully<br/>no excuses<br/>nothing at all<br/>and to what end<br/>- to what end? -<br/><br/>the answer fell<br/>on me one night<br/>right where I stood<br/>like a meteorite.
