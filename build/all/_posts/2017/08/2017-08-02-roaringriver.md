Roaring within me<br/>is a river without name<br/>waters with no colour<br/>carry life and death towards the sea<br/><br/>I am a necklace around a mountain<br/>an earring on a cloud<br/>I squeeze the energy out of it<br/>and I get nothing in return;<br/><br/>what is it that ties me to this land<br/>the spell that throws me back at it<br/>all of my imagination is useless<br/>and I am just so tired.
