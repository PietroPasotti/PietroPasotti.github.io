Every now and then as my eyes lay shut<br/>I feel a massive thunder shake the ground<br/>like a roaming monster had just found<br/>its way inside my secret hut<br/><br/>my eyes where shy behind their lids<br/>and I was shaken out of bed<br/>what is, this monster, mad?<br/>a monster that on my dreams feeds.<br/><br/>A living nightmare out of my tent<br/>letting out only peaceful thoughts<br/>all of my battles, I have already fought<br/>I make no noise, and yet my life is bent<br/><br/>do as you will, I cry again<br/>but the monster simply walks away<br/>and so he does, day after day<br/>torturing my hope into unspoken pain.
