Where the rivers sing your name<br/>you go<br/>when the devil plays your game<br/>you win<br/><br/>but isn't it true<br/>isn't it true<br/>sooner or later<br/>the devil will play you.<br/><br/>Where the winds play the leaves<br/>suggesting you with their melodies<br/>you go<br/>wandering about, as if by chance<br/>you walk<br/><br/>but isn't it soon<br/>too soon to believe<br/>all that love is for you?<br/><br/>Where the birds go 'round in pairs<br/>you go<br/>apart, then close, then stall, then chase<br/>you follow<br/><br/>but isn't it true<br/>isn't it true<br/>no little bird<br/>would ever chase you.
