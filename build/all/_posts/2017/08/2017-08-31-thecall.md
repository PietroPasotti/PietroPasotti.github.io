Another call on twisted sounds<br/>another walk on burning grounds<br/>how can any thing grow here<br/>a grand trailer park<br/>fully booked by grass and weeds<br/>may the wind that blows my seeds<br/>grin along with golden teeth<br/>may the wind that blows my mind<br/>shake the trees down to their feet.<br/><br/>When all is dead<br/>and we all dance around in ashes<br/>our feet burning in the dust<br/>only bones left of our fathers<br/>may the lost land call us back<br/>call us back<br/>to her.
