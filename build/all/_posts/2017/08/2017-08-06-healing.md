Imagine yourself healed<br/>which words would you use?<br/>Which colours would you choose<br/>to paint the skin revealed<br/><br/>after such a long ordeal?<br/>What would it reveal?<br/>Would you turn it upside down?<br/>Lift your thorns into a crown?<br/><br/>Would you take me under your wing,<br/>or rule me as a king<br/>would you hug me with affection<br/>forgive my imperfection<br/><br/>consider me a freak<br/>protect me when I'm weak<br/>and sing to me your song,<br/>for when I shall be strong?<br/><br/>Imagine yourself fine<br/>imagine yourself mine<br/>what do you see?<br/>How would you be?<br/><br/>Which heaven and which hell<br/>would you hide within your spell<br/>to tame and to release<br/>as you wish and as you please<br/><br/>which future would you sow<br/>and be willing to see grow?<br/><br/>Give a gentle nudge for every shove<br/>or do evil and call it fate,<br/>give hate in return for love<br/>or give love in return for hate?<br/><br/>Will you be patient when it's my turn<br/>to bleed into your heart like a fiery burn<br/>let me take you under my wing<br/>and listen when I sing<br/><br/>and laugh with me as we joke<br/>and give back what you take<br/>and share all that you live<br/>and take back what you give?<br/><br/><i>To Itzel...</i>
