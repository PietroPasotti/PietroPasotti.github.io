Angry creatures on the road<br/>managing frustrations<br/>waiting out damnations<br/>they are to unleash on Earth;<br/><br/>sudden movements<br/>angry giants<br/>await their moments<br/>to take revenge<br/><br/>they pounce and go<br/>disappeared, forever<br/>we'll never know<br/>what that was fore<br/><br/>we took a moonshot<br/>we missed again<br/>a roguish bullet<br/>has hit us back<br/><br/>as we ricochet<br/>against our limits<br/>have we lost sight of<br/>what we hoped to achieve<br/><br/>one word - survive<br/>nothing else matters<br/>as we jump and dive<br/>forgetful of our feathers.
