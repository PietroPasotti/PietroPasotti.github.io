There it ends<br/>my time in Delft<br/>here it goes<br/>like a comforting dream<br/>walking along these streets<br/>I've been chasing a map of my heart<br/>looking at your people<br/>at times I could feel hope<br/>and flow along your waters<br/>like a broken lotus would.<br/><br/>One last mistake:<br/>rejuvenate<br/>I lay my steps on your stones<br/>or give you my bones<br/>cuddle me one last time<br/>tonight.<br/><br/>Wrestle with my feelings<br/>not a simple deed<br/>one cliff where waves go crushing<br/>and you, of all, cannot succeed.
