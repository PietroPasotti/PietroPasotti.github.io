Behind the peak<br/>lies a rich, quiet valley<br/>you know?<br/><br/>Hidden by the crest<br/>a river flows<br/>so full of fish<br/>so fat and big<br/>that barely any water<br/>falls through anymore,<br/>you know?<br/><br/>The next valley<br/>has grass so green, they say<br/>that the cows<br/>give cheese, straight away<br/>you know?<br/><br/>And ladies and men<br/>in that foreign land<br/>are so pretty, so strong<br/>that not to call them angels<br/>would feel wrong<br/>you know?<br/><br/>Now, I'm no smart man<br/>no wizard, no scholar, no seer<br/>but sometimes I wonder:<br/>why the hell are we still here?<br/>Do you know?
