I wish you will forgive me<br/>for what I did or didn't do<br/>I could have learned so much<br/>if I had trusted you<br/><br/>and you, I wish you well,<br/>but I do it from afar<br/>we need to keep our distance<br/>and that is who we are;<br/><br/>and you, I wish you trust<br/>one day, one man, one chance,<br/>to take back what you'd lost<br/>in the depth of that one trance;<br/><br/>and you, I wish you light<br/>but not the kind you think,<br/>what you're waiting for won't come<br/>and my inner eye won't blink;<br/><br/>I wish you will look back<br/>and miss in equal measure<br/>the truth of what was painful<br/>the beauty of what was pleasure.
