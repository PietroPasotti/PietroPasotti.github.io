I walked you to a mountain<br/>and I coloured it with chalk<br/>I stare at you waiting to see<br/>I really just wanted to talk.<br/><br/>I took you hand in hand<br/>through all the routes I walk<br/>stopping by every few steps<br/>but I just wanted to talk.<br/><br/>I cried you through my shades<br/>and all the nights I stalk<br/>showed you my darkest matters<br/>and I just wanted to talk.
