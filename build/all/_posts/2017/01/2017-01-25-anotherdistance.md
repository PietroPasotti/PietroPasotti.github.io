If these mountains weren't here<br/>still you wouldn't talk to me.<br/><br/>Conjure a summer spirit<br/>still entranced by a deeper dream<br/>possessed by a darker daemon<br/>still holding your heart<br/>on the tip of a spear<br/><br/>A shadow triggers a mutation<br/>my letters are sand<br/>my syntax is fear<br/>the way I reach to you<br/>the way you hide from me<br/>a candle hidden by a different body<br/>again as if you weren't here.
