Roll a dice, the game is on<br/>the tables turn<br/>the crisis over<br/>a new wave of exhausted mayhem<br/>washes over the lonely plains<br/>what am I hiding<br/>here in plain sight<br/>in front of her, so that she sees<br/>nothing my love<br/>just combing the bees<br/><br/>down the spine<br/>chain lightning eyes wide open<br/>mouthing air like a dying whale<br/>eyeing the far sky with a molten glare<br/>passing through stars and suns<br/>cleaving over a deadly solitude<br/><br/>finally my little triangle discloses<br/>like it was always there<br/>like I always knew I knew<br/>but nowhere closer to my heart.
