It's already there<br/>on your arms<br/>can't you feel it move?<br/>Already kicking<br/>alive and all<br/>and it is minutes old<br/>its eyes are sealed<br/>its lips unspoken<br/>but the heart is there;<br/><br/>but the doors are closing<br/>we are cutting ourselves in,<br/>hours slipping by<br/>and years have gone without a word<br/>without a chance for me to speak<br/>my heart to mend, or even break<br/><br/>our bodies seem to touch<br/>but their atoms are flowing through one another.
