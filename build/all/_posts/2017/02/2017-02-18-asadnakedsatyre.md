Nothing is wrong<br/>I feel all right<br/>soon to be over<br/>soon beyond sight<br/><br/>are we running from it<br/>or forgetting what we did<br/>realising that we care too much<br/>or are we losing touch<br/><br/>disconnected from reality<br/>I am now king of my timeline<br/>and yet a slave, at the same time<br/>a passing star tripped by gravity<br/><br/>a naked satyre suddenly tired<br/>of dancing and drinking like there's no tomorrow<br/>a crippled smile stuck into his sorrow<br/>locked in the love of the star he admired.
