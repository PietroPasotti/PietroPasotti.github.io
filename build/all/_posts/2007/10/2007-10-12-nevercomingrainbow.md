It happened years ago,<br/>and then white wiped<br/>all best things I knew,<br/>then I was told to go.<br/><br/>I went along my way,<br/>but I still remember<br/>the bright light of eye,<br/>the love used to be her.<br/><br/>Walking in the rainbow<br/>the way seems so narrow<br/>but when breaks down bowlight<br/>you understand you've lived too high.<br/><br/>The world seems black and white,<br/>seen by my wounded eyes,<br/>and by my far away heart.<br/>But I paid for loving the price:<br/><br/>too much to pay,<br/>can't be ignored,<br/>can't be forgotten,<br/>I just have to wait for the nevercoming day.<br/><br/>Walking in the rainbow<br/>the way seems so narrow<br/>but when breaks down bowlight<br/>you understand you've lived too high.<br/><br/>She was she and I was I:<br/>never felt that way.<br/>I'm still waiting<br/>for the loving nevercoming.
