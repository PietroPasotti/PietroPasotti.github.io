Nothing better to be done,<br/>let's smile for who's to shine!<br/><br/>And I dance in the rain<br/>behind a mirror cloud,<br/>no more aching in this pain<br/>and to love like this I'm proud,<br/><br/>and I'm afraid and I'd retreat<br/>but that's also your defeat;<br/><br/>and I'm good and nice<br/>and a punch of rice,<br/><br/>which will grow to cover earth,<br/>under its sky still now I breath<br/>there's still one use left for my art<br/>to make shine emotion I'm beneath,<br/><br/>and I want to be happy you within<br/>and I knock on your heart, to take me in.
