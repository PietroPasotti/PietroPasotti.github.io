Am I the cat am I the mouse,<br/>running not to choose,<br/>burning the lighthouse,<br/>inside chapter ring rose;<br/><br/>and this tears that fall away<br/>and shows the sea to eye,<br/>and lets you know your way,<br/>lets the clouds rest in the bay;<br/><br/>That still is not my world,<br/>I still believe my tree is wrong,<br/>still tears are to be poured,<br/><br/>but this time I won't belong,<br/>this time I won't be just fired,<br/>and I'll bliss to something strong.
