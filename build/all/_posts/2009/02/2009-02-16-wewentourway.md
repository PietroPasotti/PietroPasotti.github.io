I wrote third chapter his conclusion,<br/>all of this just was confusion,<br/>and I can't think it was illusion.<br/><br/>Let me once again please watch,<br/>from far away this losing match,<br/>let me once first the sky touch.<br/><br/>And I will go and lose again,<br/>all to lose everything to gain,<br/>here's the reason for all this pain;<br/><br/>and our graves will touch a day,<br/>there's no to judge or pray,<br/>we all just could try to say;<br/>that we went our way.
