Pick the embrace<br/>of my reds and grays<br/>and I beg my grace<br/>to shine upon your face,<br/><br/>every tree needs<br/>to be first seeds;<br/><br/>she had her neck<br/>to be too black,<br/><br/>the runes meant love,<br/>they had to leave,<br/>they couldn't live,<br/>within her grave!<br/><br/>And she can't hear,<br/>she couldn't save,<br/>her heart from fear.
