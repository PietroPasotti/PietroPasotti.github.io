<span>I gave out all of my giving,<br/>to the sun sea to watching.<br/><br/>This dream wasnt' enough,<br/>it's due to me to make you laugh,<br/>sorry sweet that's not my place,<br/>your heart's to beat a faster pace,<br/><br/>let you know you don't need me,<br/>and that's to me how you're to be!<br/><br/>All of this is turning to sadness,<br/>believe we are our madness,<br/>look for truth into your head,<br/>try to dream, out of your bed;<br/><br/>and all of this that you live must,<br/>in my hands would be just dust.<br/></span>
