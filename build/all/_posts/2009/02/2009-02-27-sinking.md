There's no more water in the earth,<br/>this flower will just hurt,<br/>he'll last for short,<br/>shut off abort;<br/><br/>you wake up to me,<br/>walk along silently,<br/>maybe to set me free,<br/>maybe to chain the sea;<br/><br/>but iron sinks into me,<br/>as you sink into my glee,<br/>you still could flee,<br/>but still lets me be;<br/><br/>and just in the time to blink,<br/>into my blood, the moon will sink.
