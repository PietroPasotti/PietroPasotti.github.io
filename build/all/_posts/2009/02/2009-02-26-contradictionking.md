My crystal into my ring,<br/>I'm the contradiction king,<br/>my quill is from my wing,<br/>the ink is just a song;<br/><br/>I stand here,<br/>but I'm everywhere,<br/>no power or glory,<br/>to tell no story,<br/><br/>made of my moor<br/>my castle has no door,<br/>higher the towers,<br/>of tiny black flowers,<br/><br/>and here it is the addiction,<br/>of being a contradiction.
