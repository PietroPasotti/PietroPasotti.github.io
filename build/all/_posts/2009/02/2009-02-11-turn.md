As I jumped into my cloud,<br/>as I cut through the veil,<br/>I didn't think I would be proud,<br/>I wouldn't believe this fail,<br/>but this turned to dust,<br/>this turned bad fast,<br/>you turned my poison,<br/>you turned my treason!<br/><br/>I could for nights and days<br/>believe to your emptiness,<br/>to see someone into your face,<br/>to see a sense into that mess,<br/>but all of this turned up illusion,<br/>all the rest turned out confusion,<br/>but all of this turned his shoulders,<br/>and I'm alone, turned to embers!<br/><br/>And what if I turn<br/>and discover me never born?
