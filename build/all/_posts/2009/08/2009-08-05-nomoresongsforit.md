Today's a bargain<br/>you could even buy a week,<br/>don't be afraid for twenty kisses<br/>you may even buy tomorrow;<br/><br/>don't want money,<br/>don't want at all<br/>what for, what matters<br/>can't be bought;<br/><br/>she's here and watching you,<br/>want to tear up everything<br/>can't you cry, can you,<br/>can you, can you sing?
