I'll trick you<br/>as if you were myself,<br/>won't feel guilty seeing you break,<br/>I'm prepared to cut you half<br/><br/>I'll own you<br/>as if you were my will,<br/>the tears in your face grown<br/>as if you're getting ill,<br/><br/>sick again,<br/>sick nowhere,<br/>there's no blood left there to drain<br/>why are still you there?
