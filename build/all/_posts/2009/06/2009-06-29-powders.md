My eyes still are black<br/>to see through your veils,<br/>the nightmares are back<br/>and tell me their tales,<br/><br/>powder of the dreamers<br/>smoothing my sharp edges,<br/>turn into the eaters<br/>hunt down even who pledges,<br/><br/>muttering in thousands languages<br/>the words we can't avoid,<br/>make us swear our lies and promises<br/>until it's all destroyed,<br/><br/>and then as we back down<br/>will turn to the best worst,<br/>and proud of his silk crown<br/>the wind will cry his burst.
