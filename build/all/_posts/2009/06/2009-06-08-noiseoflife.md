I look in the songs<br/>the noise of your life,<br/>to make feel out the pangs<br/>even me a bit alive,<br/><br/>I try to make wrong<br/>what seems to be ok,<br/>to proof love is strong<br/>as never will be they,<br/><br/>I try to see for right<br/>what is not my fault,<br/>to look the out of sight,<br/>making pain of me I'm fault,<br/><br/>I look in your eyes<br/>to prove you I'm alive.
