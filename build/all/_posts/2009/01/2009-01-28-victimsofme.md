How many others will be<br/>victims of me, victims of me?<br/><br/>Here's the face I wanna forget,<br/>to see you cry, you rose I met?<br/><br/>So far pain's been cutting through my life,<br/>and if it's all a lie, and if it's all a lie?<br/><br/>Make a sense out of your youth,<br/>look for something better than your truth,<br/>walk along and head for south,<br/>my pole isn't any longer to be told aloud,<br/>let this chord be something more,<br/>let this finally break upon my sore.<br/><br/>And if this all is imagination,<br/>what's the source, of my creation?<br/><br/>And if it's been so unlucky birthing,<br/>what's the sense of me believing?<br/><br/>How many others will be<br/>victims of me, victims of me?
