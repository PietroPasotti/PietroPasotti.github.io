The greater you are,<br/>the more you look small;<br/>the higher fly far,<br/>the harder you fall.<br/><br/>Are we to shut up forever,<br/>are we to stop being our fever,<br/>are we to kill our ourselves,<br/>betraying our hidden halves?<br/><br/>As an iceberg, we hide the greater,<br/>as an iceberg, don't make it shatter,<br/>the greater pace it is to melt,<br/>the harder you'll be killed in pelt.<br/><br/>And once you've found a way to discover,<br/>you get it's already over.
