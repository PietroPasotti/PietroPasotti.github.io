Dancing to myself,<br/>look for a solution,<br/>dance into myself,<br/>to breakout my inaction;<br/><br/>this long red dress,<br/>is bright as stars,<br/>but if it's all useless,<br/>let's show my scars,<br/><br/>and they'll die hardly,<br/>looking at me,<br/><br/>and they'll starve<br/>breaking their nerve,<br/><br/>breathing out of me,<br/>everything I dreamt to be.
