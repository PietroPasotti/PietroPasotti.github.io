What's if an end,<br/>will come a day,<br/>not as enemy but friend,<br/>what's if like they,<br/>I can get to make it bend,<br/>to collide youth my,<br/><br/>and what's if the chain<br/>gripping my legs<br/>will break once more in pain,<br/>and let blow the flags;<br/>for my victory over rain,<br/>and I plead as she begs.<br/><br/>What's if an end,<br/>the one that I beg for,<br/>the one it's been given,<br/>the one it's not my shore.
