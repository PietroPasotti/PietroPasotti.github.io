Show off my teeth as a wolf,<br/>as I'm just sewing up myself,<br/>watch I'm torn and uprooted,<br/>watch you'll see I'm so broken;<br/><br/>broken by broken in<br/>myself now just<br/>stand up and spin,<br/>spin and spin so fast,<br/><br/>your tears won't touch you,<br/>and your eyes will be<br/>free to look once too,<br/>to me believing to see:<br/><br/>once I'm afraid I open my eyes<br/>to look and my tears now turn to ice.
