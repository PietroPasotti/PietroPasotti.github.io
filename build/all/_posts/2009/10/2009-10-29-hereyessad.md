Beside its own delusion<br/>it comes to its conclusion,<br/>she's resting on her bed<br/>shades her eyes are sad,<br/><br/>she's been crying for so long<br/>can imagine pain so fierce<br/>take her deep beneath your wing<br/>she's the cloud you pierce,<br/><br/>surround your autumn hair,<br/>hurting you she'll learn to know<br/>what's like breathing your air,<br/><br/>hurting aches winds will blow,<br/>to me turn out to be despair<br/>I'm so much afraid to show.
