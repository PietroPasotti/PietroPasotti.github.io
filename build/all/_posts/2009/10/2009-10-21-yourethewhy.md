You used to know the manner<br/>the thunder turns to wonder,<br/>white pillar clouds skyscraper,<br/>fall pieces back together;<br/><br/>are they raining us from above?<br/>Are we falling reasons ever?<br/>Are they making weep the dove?<br/>Then fall pieces, back together.<br/><br/>All they say is one day<br/>you'll be one not how,<br/>make you follow a fey<br/>just jump, jump now;<br/><br/>they're because, you're the why<br/>you forgot you can't fly.
