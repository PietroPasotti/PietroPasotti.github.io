His name was Eitounlov<br/>and he would dive<br/>into his love;<br/><br/>few words, lone rhymes<br/>could mean him his own way,<br/>nothing you ever heard<br/>nothing you'll ever say,<br/><br/>he never wrote of you<br/>blown glass black roses<br/>still burning on his neck<br/>on the chapter for his leaves,<br/><br/>his tree rot long ago,<br/>what's left of the wonder,<br/>but still there's nowhere to go.
