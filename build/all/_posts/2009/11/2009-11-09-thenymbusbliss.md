Nymbus bliss out of the nowhere,<br/>overhearing you see me out of me,<br/>I feel like I'm not wrong,<br/>I can imagine I am strong,<br/>my leaf in wind has gone so far,<br/>left you, you all behind,<br/><br/>and I can say you're nothing!<br/><br/>I'LL CRY IT! On and on,<br/>and then again<br/>since the nowhere<br/>can't be my pain.<br/><br/>Nymbus bliss into the staircase,<br/>voices echo downstairs,<br/>ans I be happy, happy for both,<br/>you can't be yourself<br/>now find your youth,<br/>nothing had changed<br/>you're stuck on yourself,<br/><br/>and my leaf has gone so far<br/>now I can't feel alone<br/>turn you into memory<br/>and turn memories to stone.
