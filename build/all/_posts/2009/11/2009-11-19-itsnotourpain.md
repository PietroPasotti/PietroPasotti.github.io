Got used to mean a sorrow,<br/>it's not our pain<br/>is our tomorrow:<br/><br/>I'll poison you,<br/>to keep you safe,<br/>within my embrace<br/>will you feel secure,<br/><br/>I'm venomous<br/>but I'm a cure,<br/>I can't be worse<br/>of what you endure;<br/><br/>got used to mean a sorrow,<br/>it's not our pain<br/>it's our tomorrow,<br/><br/>even as sad clouds<br/>blow into my eyes<br/>dirty clumsy drops<br/>who stumble upon me<br/><br/>and my thoughts do follow<br/>the oceans will they swallow;<br/><br/>got used to mean a sorrow,<br/>it's not our pain<br/>it's our tomorrow.
