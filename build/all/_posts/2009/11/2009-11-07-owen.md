I relive my cloud<br/>without relief<br/>he saw them die,<br/>everyone else,<br/><br/>those shells<br/>do not bring pearls,<br/>they love seaside<br/>but are all dead;<br/><br/>sharp edges<br/>everywhere<br/>the earth's unsafe<br/>where will you go?<br/><br/>Are you fighting, why?<br/>You will turn to firefly.
