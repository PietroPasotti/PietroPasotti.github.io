Bare trees<br/>bare hair upon the road<br/>desperately lead<br/>to nowhere.<br/>I become sad with you,<br/>turn to grey and then<br/>without expecting<br/>but snowy kisses from no one,<br/>walk on, walk on,<br/><br/>but I won't be ok.<br/><br/>Won't rain hopes<br/>won't cry joy,<br/>just a faceless<br/>fragile boy;<br/><br/>and out of a shadow<br/>you tell me to go,<br/>will I be sad enough<br/>not to stop and wait for you?
