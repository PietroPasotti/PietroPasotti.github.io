I'm giving back what you give me,<br/>softer than I should<br/>try to make me weep once more,<br/>but once sank I found my shore,<br/>and I am safe.<br/><br/>Shrink my heart ignoring<br/>I glitter at your same pace<br/>forgetting leaves I shouldn't have<br/>but memories are hard to leave,<br/>and I feel safe.<br/><br/>I know you can no longer hurt<br/>it's me who gave me birth<br/>and I am safe.
