If the rainbow broke<br/>is my fault<br/>but what am I to change,<br/><br/>if it's in me well that<br/>is me,<br/>and yes I do feel strange,<br/><br/>everything I do for you<br/>makes sense<br/>as I become,<br/><br/>and I become<br/>what I can't feel<br/>because I'm only one,<br/><br/>difference<br/>make me trust myself,<br/>but I'm not feeling fine,<br/><br/>that's the dipping<br/>kiss of down<br/>that's drenching up my brain,<br/><br/>drops of solitude<br/>in me<br/>begin to give me pain,<br/><br/>and once again<br/>I find myself<br/>imploring storms to rain;<br/><br/>imagine how I felt<br/>as I've seen<br/>you becoming dust,<br/><br/>and once again<br/>I found myself<br/>alone alone and lost;<br/><br/>feelings got emotions<br/>from their side<br/>and wanted me,<br/><br/>and who was I<br/>to say no thanks,<br/>so just let I them be;<br/><br/>truths can cover up<br/>my eyes but<br/>won't shut up my tears<br/><br/>discovering in you<br/>my dreams<br/>could weep above my fears;<br/><br/>and tell me what's a will<br/>without<br/>a reason to become,<br/><br/>like that without a future<br/>I pretended<br/>you were gone;<br/><br/>imagine I'm a drowning child<br/>such force<br/>would mean my life,<br/><br/>and ending like a leaf<br/>I found<br/>the moon had been my wife;<br/><br/>and married with the rain again<br/>afar,<br/>afar from hope,<br/><br/>I twisted truths to catch them all<br/>within my eyes'<br/>sad scope;<br/><br/>I never fell so softly you<br/>know<br/>won't ever return<br/><br/>again like this<br/>to be water<br/>healin' my hands are burn,<br/><br/>Never has a hope in me<br/>got far, so far<br/>from real,<br/><br/>if that's all<br/>I get to sing<br/>imagine how I feel.<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">Con un Grazie, a Roby</span>
