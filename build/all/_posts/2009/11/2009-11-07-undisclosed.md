Admiring<br/>restless peace,<br/>consolation<br/>lies in silence<br/>undisclosed love,<br/>gets wasted within me<br/>rotting like my joy<br/>unsafe for I annoy,<br/><br/>purity admire<br/>every hour a scar,<br/>a pang at the heart,<br/>everything's on fire<br/>and I can't help<br/>to suffocate and sink<br/>myself.<br/><br/>Admiring<br/>my undisclosed love<br/>I rest,<br/>all, but felt alive.
