I've been trying to give you up<br/>but there's no hope<br/>into these lies,<br/><br/>I've been hoping for a life<br/>that would be safe<br/>within the blows,<br/><br/>I've been catching butterflies<br/>and then I face<br/>this is a lie,<br/><br/>but everything will come to all<br/>and then slowly<br/>begin to fall,<br/>and then in me will come the blow<br/>stolen a bottle<br/>I won't fill,<br/><br/>and then you are<br/>alone.<br/><br/>I've been trying to give it up,<br/>to walk along<br/>and trust you but,<br/><br/>narcotic lies are showing out<br/>to make me shout<br/>to craziness,<br/><br/>but everything will come to all<br/>and then slowly<br/>begin to fall,<br/>but all the promises you made,<br/>you worked on you<br/>without being paid,<br/>but all the chances you had to leave,<br/>it was useless,<br/>you want to live,<br/><br/>and then, still I'm<br/>alone.<br/><br/>Petrified gazes glance on me<br/>but I'm not ready<br/>to be stone,<br/><br/>poison caress tempting me<br/>so venomous<br/>is getting she,<br/><br/>will not be safe below her lies<br/>she'll need to face<br/>but will give up,<br/><br/>but everything will come to all<br/>and then slowly<br/>begin to fall,<br/>but when will come the day for me<br/>will I be ready<br/>to be free,<br/><br/>and then to leave<br/>alone.<br/><br/>But everything will come to all<br/>and as you did<br/>begin to fall,<br/>but aching words still bleed for me<br/>since I'm not ready<br/>to feel free,<br/><br/>and then I feel<br/>alone.
