Smile.<br/>A black phoenix will fly soon,<br/>she's born under the moon,<br/>she's born to save us all<br/>her dark eyes are made to fill,<br/><br/>our light hearts with grief,<br/>is it time for disbelief,<br/>or is it time to wake and live,<br/>you can't tell what you believe.<br/><br/>Shine.<br/>A black phoenix thrusts in air,<br/>speeding in her lair,<br/>she's love without a reason<br/>but her blood is drenched in poison,<br/><br/>many voices spoke of fear,<br/>but nothing she could hear,<br/>and nocturne feathers waving<br/>she then begun slow fading.
