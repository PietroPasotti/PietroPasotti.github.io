I need to breathe<br/>please let me breathe,<br/>I want to hide you<br/>and then to breathe again.<br/><br/>I failed forgiving<br/>stood still in diving<br/>the floods kept running<br/>I need dot swim away<br/>and hide.<br/><br/>To start again I breathe<br/>thirsty drinking breathe,<br/>liberation whispers freedom<br/>to all of this to breathe<br/>within illusion.
