Many faces<br/>without a core<br/>you never like<br/>what you endure,<br/><br/>as images hard to summon,<br/>still be followed by your daemon,<br/>I want you darker<br/>I want you softer;<br/><br/>seems hard to concentrate<br/>on thoughts you can't create,<br/>feel thief of one's frail soul<br/>but is it you to crawl;<br/><br/>I want you darker<br/>from the very inside<br/>can't be me, but brighter:<br/>only shadows cannot fade;<br/><br/>let me say your smile<br/>the inner one gets pale<br/>I cannot breathe I faint<br/>out of time for my complaint.
