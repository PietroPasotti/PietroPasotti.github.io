And ever again alone<br/>I hope in hopes are gone,<br/>and ever and ever<br/>I hope the next forever,<br/>one per chapter,<br/>one per year,<br/>until the shatter,<br/>of another fear;<br/><br/>and ever again I'll say<br/>I used to shine, but didn't they,<br/>and I will bleed<br/>refusing creed,<br/>and throwing up again<br/>all of my pain, all of my pain;<br/><br/>and ever again I will<br/>donate another piece of will,<br/>and I will write my own<br/>once the window's shown,<br/>and I look forward to jumping,<br/>to teach once more again<br/>the sky made for flying<br/>to be, but not in vain.<br/><br/>And forever again I'll lie<br/>upon the corpses,<br/>of my promises,<br/>I'm not being to lie.
