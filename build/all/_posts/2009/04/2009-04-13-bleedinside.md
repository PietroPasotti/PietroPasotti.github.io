I can't shout<br/>can't speak<br/>you're not there<br/>and I bleed inside<br/>I can't speak<br/>I won't become<br/>your ghost<br/>I'm mist I'm dust,<br/>and you have lost<br/>and I'm alone<br/>and I can't shout,<br/>you'd feel guilty<br/>but that's not me,<br/>and you still ignore<br/>how I am pain<br/>how I am emotion<br/>still all in vain;<br/>and I bleed inside<br/>cant' do anything<br/>can't shout to me<br/>can't speak to you<br/>and I hope I will<br/>all soon get through.<br/><br/>All beginning to fade<br/>and still I bleed inside.
