The sky should be blue<br/>I can't get through,<br/><br/>this will be towards our end<br/>and you will wish good luck<br/>and if in the end my friend<br/>I won't at all be back,<br/><br/>the sky could be blue<br/>if only you want it too,<br/><br/>this all will lead us darkness<br/>this all if we don't stop<br/>give an order to this mess<br/>find the end to this death loop,<br/><br/>our sky can't be blue<br/>without me or without you,<br/><br/>help me explain to us this all<br/>stop the floods breaking the rocks,<br/>make flow again the waterfall<br/>and fix again the heart who breaks,<br/><br/>our sky won't be blue<br/>if you don't give me a clue,<br/><br/>this is not due just to me<br/>it's torn apart by emotion<br/>unless we don't want One to be<br/>we should break up with illusion,<br/><br/>our sky needs to be blue<br/>so need I and so need you,<br/><br/>touched by the sound of a rain<br/>every blow brings to my heart<br/>one more ache and once more pain<br/>and won't find end as does my art.
