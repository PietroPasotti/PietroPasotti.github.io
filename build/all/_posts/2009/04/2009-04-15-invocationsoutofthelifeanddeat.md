The only truth<br/>can't be the one of death,<br/>I don't want to live<br/>like this to believe,<br/>all I'm to wait for,<br/>can't be more, can't be more;<br/><br/>I learned the faith<br/>of love I breathe,<br/>but it's not enough<br/>since the life is tough,<br/>and death the same as well,<br/>me you and a wall, me you and a wall;<br/><br/>and I feel more and more<br/>the tears the sore,<br/>and I feel more alone<br/>every day is night zone,<br/>and so again why am I to live,<br/>this death I don't believe, this death I don't believe;<br/><br/>how far can hope give me<br/>am I to breathe or just to be?<br/>I need my life I want it now<br/>and I'm dying to get somehow,<br/>the truth out of illusion,<br/>and I'm at the conclusion, and I'm at the conclusion;<br/><br/>feelings of death and life<br/>we just want to be safe,<br/>teaching myself to turn to grey<br/>if I don't want so needed they,<br/>and I can't be who I am,<br/>without ink I am a pen, without ink I am a pen;<br/><br/>chasing everyday what I fight for<br/>I turn to worse me more and more,<br/>and suddenly alone I see<br/>there's no more sense for me,<br/>and suddenly my life is grey,<br/>I can't say, I can't say;<br/><br/>I'd give anything in this when<br/>to believe once more to Keleden,<br/>and she will come upon her legs<br/>making truth of these bloody drugs,<br/>I'll stop myself to kill,<br/>beginning to be who I will, beginning to be who I will.
