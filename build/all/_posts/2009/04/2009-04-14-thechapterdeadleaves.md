Death leaves<br/>the dead leaves,<br/><br/>they slowly fall to ground<br/>and I begin as well to fall<br/>neglecting what was found,<br/>another brick another wall,<br/><br/>death leaves<br/>the dead leaves,<br/><br/>and they lie in front of me<br/>almost corrupted by silence,<br/>showing how they used to be<br/>another spear another fence,<br/><br/>death leaves<br/>the dead leaves,<br/><br/>and there's another<br/>beautiful page now red<br/>for a newly cried new chapter<br/>that will be same death as bad,<br/><br/>death leaves<br/>the dead leaves,<br/><br/>for you everything so far<br/>and I am not and I won't be<br/>all is right until you are,<br/>but there's no room for me;<br/><br/>death leaves<br/>the dead leaves,<br/><br/>and she leaves them here<br/>to be lost once more forever<br/>and they will be my fear,<br/>as they can't clean this shatter;<br/><br/>death leaves<br/>the dead leaves,<br/><br/>and I breathe again<br/>even if I don't want to,<br/>you're not all but you're the main<br/>but it's not the same for you,<br/><br/>death leaves<br/>the dead leaves,<br/><br/>and she flies again all over<br/>she doesn't care any more,<br/>she won't at all come closer,<br/>so there's no way to end the sore;<br/><br/>death leaves<br/>the dead leaves,<br/><br/>and the chapter for the death<br/>of the leaves waiting to go,<br/>will be here until I breath,<br/>ending to do like I am to.
