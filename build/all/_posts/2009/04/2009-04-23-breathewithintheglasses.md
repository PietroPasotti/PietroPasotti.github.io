Whispering in the windows,<br/>should overcome my pain,<br/>fragments out of sorrows,<br/>and I look for I'm slain,<br/><br/>preventing me to breathe,<br/>another shadow gone,<br/>another broken whisper,<br/>and everything is done,<br/><br/>and if I'm world you owe me something back,<br/>keep me out of this sadness,<br/>the glasses crying make me sick,<br/>make them shut up, make them break,<br/><br/>everything is harder,<br/>still looking for a muse,<br/>and still I look look I for,<br/>love's a chance not an excuse,<br/><br/>like a flower poem,<br/>corrupting my own luck,<br/>still I look further even<br/>if there's no coming back;<br/><br/>taking off my hope now,<br/>I won't see her again,<br/>and still I ask myself how<br/>could overcome the pain,
