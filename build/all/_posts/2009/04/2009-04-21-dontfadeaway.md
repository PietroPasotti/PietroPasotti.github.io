Don't fade away,<br/>fade into me,<br/>together not fray,<br/>find a way to be;<br/><br/>don't fade<br/>don't fade away,<br/>we're made<br/>to be like they say,<br/><br/>the stars<br/>we look upon,<br/>and scars<br/>will still shine on,<br/><br/>and the comet is to dance,<br/>be frost into your glance.
