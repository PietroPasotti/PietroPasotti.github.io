Everything seems fine<br/>as if you were<br/>as good as me,<br/>as good as you<br/>nobody else<br/>in fire or sands<br/>and love or tears<br/>or sick and cheers,<br/>and didn't look<br/>as nice as you,<br/><br/>with a whiter dress<br/>more like a friend<br/>more like a none,<br/>and if I sparkle<br/>then you shine<br/>and if I'm sun,<br/>you blow the night,<br/>right upon us<br/>you're fight and I<br/>am peace and you<br/>keep killing me,<br/><br/>and I can't do<br/>anything but look<br/>for whiter shades,<br/>instead of you<br/>ghost yesterday<br/>trapped in a dream<br/>constrained in me,<br/>constrict in you,<br/>and I can't help<br/>it will end now<br/>has it begun.<br/><br/>Like some phantom clouds<br/>all memories<br/>turn out to be,<br/>poisonous thick<br/>thin swords like air<br/>that I can't mend<br/>you can't repair,<br/><br/>embodied wounds<br/>I stuck on you<br/>they walk along,<br/>straight on your face,<br/>and I can see<br/>what I have done<br/>and I regret<br/>all brilliance shone.<br/><br/>Disembodied wounds<br/>I stuck on you<br/>they walk along,<br/>straight on your face<br/>and I can see<br/>what I have done<br/>and I regret<br/>all brilliance shone.
