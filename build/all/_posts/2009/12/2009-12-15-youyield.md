I see you ending,<br/>ice would seem as poor<br/>but no surface on you,<br/>no line to blur tonight,<br/><br/>I see you yield<br/>ghostly unbalanced<br/>flying past the field<br/>filled with empty memories,<br/><br/>I see you afraid<br/>no effort would let me come<br/>no promise can save me now<br/>nothing be the same;<br/><br/>I see you stone<br/>a pale reflection of you<br/>inhuman poisons exhale<br/>taking over what's been true;<br/><br/>I see you end<br/>and I finally understand<br/>why I ice pretend<br/>to be water like I bend.
