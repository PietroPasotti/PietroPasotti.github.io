There's a dream, appear<br/>will I ever have<br/>the chance to see this clear?<br/><br/>Forwarding step to step<br/>leaping high like an illusion<br/>there's no time to be regret<br/>you're left there without solution;<br/><br/>postponing the word goodbye<br/>are you forgetting to be mine<br/>it's my favourite worst lie<br/>I'm the grape, you deserve wine,<br/><br/>our time is being our end,<br/>upon the pieces<br/>I've spent a life to mend.
