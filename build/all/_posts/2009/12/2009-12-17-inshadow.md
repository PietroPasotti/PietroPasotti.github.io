Afraid or scared,<br/>mermaids have dared,<br/>shy clouds twinkle, far above us.<br/><br/>I can't trust,<br/>wave my hands<br/>and turn you rust,<br/>my sea has blown you up,<br/>far higher than I leap,<br/>but I keep looking fast<br/><br/>for evidence of you,<br/>I can't keep kissing ghosts,<br/>and the road herself<br/>in shadow lost.
