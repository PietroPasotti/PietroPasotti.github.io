Continuously interlace<br/>wasted your embrace,<br/>kiss the trees,<br/>to be much more than this;<br/><br/>stomping but wounded<br/>fighting your way out<br/>of a dream that has been framed<br/>instead of becoming sprout.<br/><br/>Thin memories, no more,<br/>they sink in their own secret<br/>thick fogs keep hiding sore,<br/><br/>renewing every regret,<br/>I've never been before<br/>of a darker shade of violet.
