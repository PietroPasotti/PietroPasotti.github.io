Time dropping<br/>tickling down the trees<br/>I fly by<br/>wanting it to end<br/>needing yours<br/>in my waving hand,<br/>and think of me,<br/>some day,<br/>I never stare at emptiness<br/>like beauty is a vision<br/>this feels I like you<br/>this like I feel you,<br/>like your clumsy steps<br/>deafening snowflakes<br/>without a flower,<br/>and petals are no more.
