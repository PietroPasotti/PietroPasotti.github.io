Eyes are still, frozen,<br/>lighter than air, they are,<br/>I don't like, I deny<br/>the idea of making whisper<br/>out of their shadow well,<br/><br/>would you like it?<br/>Would you pull the rope and drink?<br/>Would I be loved, or would I sink?<br/><br/>Eyes look still, but under,<br/>there is image of a whisper,<br/>love comes from a surrender.
