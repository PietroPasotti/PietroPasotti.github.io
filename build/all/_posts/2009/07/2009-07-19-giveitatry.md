Had enough<br/>of lullabies enough,<br/>of stars and lies<br/>of failures and successes,<br/>your smile is threatened<br/>you will not laugh,<br/>you had enough;<br/>enough,<br/>and this won't join<br/>as another tear the sea,<br/>and this won't enlighten<br/>as another blink the ceiling,<br/>give up don't cry,<br/>and give it a try.
