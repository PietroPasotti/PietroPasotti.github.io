Thin as a whisper<br/>sweet as a candy<br/>your hope is the never,<br/>you're Heaven the Dandy;<br/><br/>brighter than a sun,<br/>are you one or being us all,<br/>nobody with your gun<br/>just shattered on the wall;<br/><br/>be the never, be forever,<br/>be the hope until keeps windy,<br/>waterfalls look like a shower<br/>you're Heaven the last Dandy;<br/><br/>live alone in the downtown,<br/>torn up what you left for,<br/>your red is not a brown,<br/>is there a silence after a sore;<br/><br/>there's no castle in empty bricks,<br/>will your shore ever be sandy,<br/>are there fronts behind those backs,<br/>you're alone, Heaven the Dandy.
