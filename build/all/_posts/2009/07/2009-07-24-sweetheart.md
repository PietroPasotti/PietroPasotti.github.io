Sweetheart you're the desert<br/>in which I force my life,<br/>sweetheart you're the waves<br/>upon my lake's surface<br/>and as a contradiction<br/>the contrary for me,<br/>sweetheart you still when<br/>I'm hating to hate you,<br/>sweetheart even more when<br/>I'm needle just to hit me<br/>the contrast as a mission<br/>flat-footed on the glacier<br/>sweetheart as a word<br/>I look for fields when you're a world.
