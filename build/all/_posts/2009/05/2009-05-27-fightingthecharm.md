A tremble is running<br/>along my shaken head,<br/>it's like my heart is bleeding,<br/>I've never been so bad;<br/><br/>beware sensations<br/>look too strong,<br/>that's why emotions<br/>are always wrong;<br/><br/>enjoy the dirty pleasure<br/>of another tearful ending,<br/>take joy out of the rupture<br/>she's beside you living,<br/><br/>didn't you mean to harm?<br/>It's too late to stop the charm...
