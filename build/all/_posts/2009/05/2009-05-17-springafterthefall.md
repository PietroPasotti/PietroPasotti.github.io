I see you near the river mad,<br/>colouring the rain in red,<br/>to show the moon you are<br/>so sad,<br/><br/>neither will your love be faith,<br/>but will absorb all of your breath,<br/>until there's nothing left<br/>but sweat,<br/><br/>and tears but you don't care,<br/>still don't know how much to dare,<br/>how much to give not to remain<br/>that bare,<br/><br/>but you give, you give it all,<br/>still hoping<br/>into a Spring after the Fall.
