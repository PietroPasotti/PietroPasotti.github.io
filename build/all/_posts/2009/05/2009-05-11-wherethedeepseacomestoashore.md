Running out of fears,<br/>can't be afraid of me,<br/>you're the next and so<br/>feel within the tears,<br/>and fall with them<br/>to the dream of the night;<br/><br/>and inside a memory,<br/>you'll find a place to burn,<br/>and breathe the smoke<br/>to go with me once more,<br/>where the deep sea comes to a shore.
