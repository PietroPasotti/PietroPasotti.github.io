Stretching in the blast,<br/>of someone looking beautiful,<br/>this dream will fading fast,<br/>became as you more wonderful,<br/><br/>as if I was delight,<br/>as you would change up everything,<br/>and getting out of sight,<br/>ask me what is happening;<br/><br/>will you fade tonight,<br/>your eyes are broken promises,<br/>and go on holding tight,<br/>to find the wounded differences,<br/><br/>I look in you see bleeding now,<br/>I won't stare at your death,<br/>I'm told to never ask you how,<br/>but wind is blowing breath,<br/><br/>we could have been more than we are,<br/>but I'll just dream at you,<br/>and without need to go so far,<br/>I'll find a sky being blue;<br/><br/>help you out to give up all,<br/>will brighten everywhere,<br/>towards the sky flows waterfall,<br/>to show her how you care,<br/><br/>the sea is weak wants me no more,<br/>and will say me goodbye,<br/>and suffering the deeper core<br/>will know how I am I.
