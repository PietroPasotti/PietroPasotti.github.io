Rachel words don't need,<br/>Rachel words won't last,<br/>love again the seed,<br/>that fade away will dust;<br/><br/>Rachel everything I told,<br/>was the prayer of a fool,<br/>the sad tears of an old,<br/>trembling the dark and cool;<br/><br/>Rachel believe the truth of love,<br/>nothing needs the world more,<br/>Rachel words don't move,<br/>perhaps a kiss will share the sore;<br/><br/>Rachel you're a memory,<br/>just a name beyond a face,<br/>or another broken fantasy,<br/>made to share another ache;<br/><br/>Rachel thank you so much,<br/>give me once more the pain,<br/>to make me fly but keep in touch,<br/>to make me hope that's not in vain.
