Petals close upon my rest,<br/>I was asleep,<br/>sharpened cut into my chest,<br/>fall, fall deep;<br/><br/>all the colour was a lie,<br/>this is evil,<br/>but as I get that near to die,<br/>careless of the devil,<br/><br/>I swallowed in my past,<br/>never mind the future,<br/>now that all is lost,<br/>still think to that old picture<br/><br/>the petals are closing,<br/>in the flower swallow,<br/>sweetest nectar is confusing,<br/>there is no light to follow;<br/><br/>and fall and fall<br/>and deeper now,<br/>nothing is all,<br/>never looked what I saw.
