And I'm in the nothing,<br/>the nowhere is still calling,<br/>and then why not to listen,<br/>to this promise of a glisten?<br/><br/>The leaves will sparkle down,<br/>lift me from where I drown,<br/>bare trees will surely come,<br/>and this is how this place undone;<br/><br/>hidden in the hopeless,<br/>the nowhere still yelling,<br/>the scream full of obsess,<br/><br/>that I go on forgiving,<br/>give up the days of bliss,<br/>they're not so worth of living.
