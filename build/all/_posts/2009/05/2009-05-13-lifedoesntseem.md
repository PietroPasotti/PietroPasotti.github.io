Life doesn't seem,<br/>but why does she need to be?<br/>She's nothing to redeem,<br/>is she bound but still she's free,<br/><br/>how can I pretend<br/>to be enough to understand,<br/>a piece of a jigsaw<br/>made I don't know how,<br/><br/>is the destiny to follow,<br/>this fragments of a life,<br/>a track I am so shallow,<br/>but can't go on to strife;<br/><br/>and will she believe<br/>once and for all,<br/>that if I don't live,<br/>then I will fall?
