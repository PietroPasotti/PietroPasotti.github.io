Don't ask me why,<br/>afraid to die,<br/>a mirror of a pool<br/>shows your face of fool,<br/><br/>believe in dreams aware,<br/>I only trust nightmare,<br/>the dull truth which breaks,<br/>there are no tricks,<br/><br/>just you, and me and fear,<br/>we're both alone my dear,<br/>inside out the face of snow,<br/>sun gets high, the moon still low.
