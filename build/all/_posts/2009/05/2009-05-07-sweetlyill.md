The sound is so sweet,<br/>here love to hate meet,<br/>will bow to greater joy,<br/>there without a when or why,<br/><br/>here the mountain meets the hill,<br/>and here he is, so sweetly ill.<br/><br/>Here a new face,<br/>of this deadly pace,<br/>I'll crush into the wall,<br/>everything again will fall,<br/><br/>and if the hill is not at all,<br/>why is elsewhere so dull?<br/><br/>Here accidentally I felt,<br/>a stranger way to melt,<br/>and to the sea my way,<br/>says there's nothing else to say,<br/><br/>emptiness my heart still fill,<br/>to be cured, so sweetly ill.<br/><br/>I'd love to fade away like that,<br/>but I fade away who met,<br/>and I hadn't enough time,<br/>to find one last sick rhyme,<br/><br/>is this illness off my home,<br/>can I go back to consume.<br/><br/>Plead myself to have pity,<br/>I haven't mercy even for me,<br/>and there's no room left,<br/>into my heart still I'm to craft,<br/><br/>and I know Keleden will,<br/>be the cure, till there I'm ill,<br/>so sweetly, sweetly ill.
