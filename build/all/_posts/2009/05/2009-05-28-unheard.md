Started asking to the wind unheard<br/>do you feel anything?<br/>Are we so numb and scared<br/>refusing to be living?<br/><br/>Soon the waves will wipe out<br/>all the wind hasn't said yet,<br/>despair despair unheard you shout<br/>all the pain you can't forget;<br/><br/>destiny pains and struggles inside<br/>moving the water,<br/>go far alone away for a ride,<br/>find a way throughout the shatter;<br/><br/>and what if that way's to bend,<br/>towards the bliss and endless end?
