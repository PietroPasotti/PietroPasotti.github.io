I close my eyes<br/>still trusting you,<br/>I fall in dreams<br/>I sleep careless,<br/>fall upon your arms,<br/>the heat of bliss,<br/>I feel<br/>inside<br/>the care<br/>the cure,<br/>within you;<br/><br/>then I open my eyes<br/>where are you gone,<br/>where is this place<br/>and what have I done;<br/><br/>then I open my mouth<br/>can't breathe can't speak<br/>can't cry can't shout,<br/>just willing to break;<br/><br/>then I open my heart<br/>and I give it all<br/>the memory is being short<br/>but I will let it fall;<br/><br/>you could watch it give,<br/>you your last wish alive.
