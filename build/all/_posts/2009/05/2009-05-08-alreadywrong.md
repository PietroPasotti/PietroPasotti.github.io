Taste the rain, today she's sandy,<br/>like the desert fighting wind,<br/>this water drops are sandy,<br/>and how can she swallow the sand?<br/><br/>Under the sand still lives somehow,<br/>a people's dream sang out a song,<br/>please my wind go on to blow,<br/>all the sands I am among,<br/><br/>but my eyes still look so low,<br/>have never been less strong,<br/><br/>to this greatest presence bow,<br/>feeling this, already wrong.
