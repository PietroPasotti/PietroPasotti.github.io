And there's a word<br/>that's not going to change,<br/>there's still a world<br/>waiting for revenge,<br/>resound your chord,<br/>and will all seem strange;<br/><br/>and don't you believe<br/>it's all revolving around,<br/>another honey dive<br/>of the cliffs you haven't found;<br/><br/>it's just a shame you're still alive,<br/>but after all, you cannot dive.
