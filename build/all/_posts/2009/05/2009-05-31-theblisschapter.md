Like if you were a fantasy,<br/>or another dream aware,<br/>let us be our melody,<br/>and sing it that awake;<br/><br/>they all will turn<br/>as hectic as my imagination,<br/>here it comes our turn<br/>to make our way to this emotion;<br/><br/>through a bleeding sky<br/>the rain is arising dead,<br/>aren't we made to fly<br/>without walking that bad?
