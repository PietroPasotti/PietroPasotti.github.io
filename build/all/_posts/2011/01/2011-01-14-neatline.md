There's a neat line<br/>in the sky<br/>and in your eyes<br/><br/>there's a neat lie<br/>above us all<br/>they talk to me<br/>I hear the call<br/><br/>we won't ruin<br/>and spoil our destinies<br/>I'll come with you<br/>towards our memories.<br/><br/>Somehow<br/>we stand once more<br/>we fail to cease existing<br/>we chose a word to spell<br/>within the games of magic<br/>midnights upon my bell.
