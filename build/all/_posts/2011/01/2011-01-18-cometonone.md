It seems I have come to none<br/>my silence somehow has broken me<br/>and my shut eyes have torn<br/>the avenues won't bend to me<br/>and still along I walk.<br/><br/>I think I've reached the limits<br/>my thoughts have come to end<br/>write I can no more<br/>nor live nor breath, any more.<br/><br/>I think I've come to the top<br/>or the bottom, I don't know,<br/>since the roof's the next one's floor,<br/><br/>I speak to none<br/>I write to none<br/>feeling soft and tired.
