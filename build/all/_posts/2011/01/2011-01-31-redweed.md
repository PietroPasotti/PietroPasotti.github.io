Huge things are moving 'round,<br/>a piano spells his stories<br/>all windows closed<br/>not a face or shameless grace<br/><br/>will pride her joy for me,<br/>in the sign of a sound<br/>out there it all keeps moving<br/>I dreamt it was exploding<br/><br/>until the day of daemons<br/>I think I won't be hopeless<br/>the red weed we caress<br/>wil once grow higher.
