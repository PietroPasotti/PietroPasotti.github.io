Don't even spend a second thinking<br/>that you're the only one to fall.<br/>Don't even make a mistake laughing<br/>at what may soon begin to call<br/><br/>at us, at us, at us, there's something in the air<br/>and no, it isn't fair<br/>and no, that isn't right<br/>behind the blast there is a fight<br/><br/>right on her side<br/>a red smile wide<br/>he grins and fast<br/>returns the blast.<br/><br/>Don't even spend a second twinkling<br/>at old faint dying reddened stars<br/>abandon ships to cowards sinking<br/>and drive so fast and jump to Mars<br/><br/>so as to hide forever trace<br/>of tears upon your kindest face.<br/><br/>The flames were shed upon the world<br/>in a very rainy day<br/>we thought at once the freedom was<br/>a worthy price to pay.<br/><br/>The flames devouring eyes and hair<br/>a faster pleasure would be fair<br/>but slow hands slow paces<br/>are taking me to different places.<br/><br/>The distance in my heart is growing higher<br/>the line I'm tracing begins to cycle<br/>across the lands and seas and I<br/>can't bear the silence walking further.<br/><br/>Please you roads, you roots,<br/>bend.<br/>Bend to cross my fiery nonsense<br/>my whole symbolic lacks of contents<br/>and I stand still behind a wall of ice<br/>transforming me into an army of mice<br/>to climb the cliffside almost running<br/>and balance on a leaf sky drifting.
