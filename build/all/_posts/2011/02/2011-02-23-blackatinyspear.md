<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left">Black a tiny spear<br/>and finally relieved<br/>I stand and look<br/>we all stand and look somehow,<br/><br/>and since the moon is full<br/>and since our lips cry fool<br/>still smiling still burning<br/>will we ever ache again?<br/><br/>One another in one another<br/>all of a sudden I seem to understand<br/>if I never had a fever<br/>I'd have had nothing to mend.<br/><br/>In there it's it<br/>right in the color<br/>right in the peace<br/>melting ices<br/>go insane<br/>right on the surface<br/>oh I'd want to be light<br/>so as to walk on the floating ice<br/>cold as a stone<br/>cold as a mountain<br/><br/>every wound has a broken heart inside<br/>maybe<br/>fix me<br/>but there<br/>all of a sudden, all in all,<br/>all the mountain climbs the wall<br/>and stares an endless plain<br/>we climbed so high but not in vain<br/>we found our faces in midair<br/>are you ready?<br/>I am here.<br/>
