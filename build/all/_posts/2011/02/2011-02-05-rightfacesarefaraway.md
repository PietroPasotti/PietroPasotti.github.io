I can't remember the right faces<br/>some positions slip off my thoughts<br/>some bodies refuse my embraces<br/>until the dreams it won't be night<br/>and some ways<br/>are high<br/>some others are alone<br/>and some days<br/>you're right<br/>some others you're alone,<br/><br/>the first november we were there<br/>december yet no more<br/>the days have flown another way<br/>another path has been retraced<br/>I try to face this thought being quiet<br/>but haunted here we lie,<br/>and some boxes<br/>aren't closed<br/>some others just won't shut<br/>and some eyes<br/>are always ready<br/>some others will refuse,<br/><br/>a vintage photo is afraid of me<br/>or I'm afraid of here<br/><br/>it hurts here I remember<br/>this I couldn't forget.
