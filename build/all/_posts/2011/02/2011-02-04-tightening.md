<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left">I'm tightening the knot<br/>and closer to the dot<br/>we listen to all rains<br/>and walk across the ruins<br/><br/>oh, I'm watching the ashes<br/>I already see the sky cry<br/>the thunder without flashes<br/>oh, I desperate need to fly;<br/><br/>faster as I float<br/>the words aren't so neat<br/>they're weak they're smooth<br/>I need to soothe<br/>and to retreat.<br/><br/>We have the air<br/>on the other side<br/>an endless slow descent<br/>the stars that glow will not<br/>are closer to the dot.<br/>
