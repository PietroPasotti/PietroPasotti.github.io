<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left">I hate feeling far from me<br/>far from everything I want<br/>I stop my steps<br/>they fall like august leaves<br/>a river I can't bend falls along my cheeks<br/>and suddenly my face<br/>turns into frozen fields of dust.<br/>I'm guilty like I'm feeling guilty<br/>and shanty calls the open space my ears<br/>they seem to hear you there<br/>but still I'm feeling far,<br/>this fault is a dead line<br/>a gap tears won't fill up<br/>hold on with all my strength<br/>and then keep holding but the river wins<br/>the rivers always win<br/>they say the stream won't ever fail<br/>won't ever stop<br/>my heart's a jail.<br/>I beg for mercy<br/>but I never listen to my echoes<br/>I'm a tale<br/>that is not about its heroes.<br/>With the hidden calm<br/>and the suffocated bites<br/>my hunger slips on me<br/>I seem to reach my pace<br/>my idea of a thin line,<br/>all straights do somewhere meet<br/>because every line is a circle.<br/><br/>This is not an illness<br/>I am not a symptom<br/>that's pride of a madness.<br/><br/>Where all the space meets its every line<br/>there the words will find their rhyme.<br/><br/>Significant squares<br/>mapping my steps<br/>an unavoidable grid<br/>shines like a silver net all around us<br/>our feet refuse to hit the ground<br/>I hid my face not to see the lines<br/>and you are who I found.<br/>Silently my heart slows down<br/>finally the tide has retreated her plague<br/>finally my cave shines again with light<br/>we all refuse the pieces of a broken star<br/>but we still wait there since all is far,<br/>shining with a crazy tremor<br/>I step out the grid,<br/>on a line<br/>that is me<br/>this is fine<br/>this is all<br/>part of my time.<br/>It seems sometimes<br/>there are rivers we won't cross<br/>are they behind our shoulders?<br/>Still the waters can move boulders.<br/>
