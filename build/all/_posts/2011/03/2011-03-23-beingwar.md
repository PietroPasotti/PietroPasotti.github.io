<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left">I don't need war in me<br/>I don't need thousand couples of eyes<br/>sneaking into a fiery field<br/>the dust is light has covered everything<br/>and now we leave footprints<br/>even with our thoughts<br/>they'll see what you think<br/>where your eyes run to<br/>a gray powder over everything<br/>you can't lie on the grass any&nbsp;more<br/>you're there<br/>in front of me<br/>I'm still you're running<br/>I'm stealing your very being.<br/>
