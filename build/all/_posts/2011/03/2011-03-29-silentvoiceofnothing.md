<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left">The silent voice of Nothing<br/>slowly slips like a veil on my lips with his tail<br/>he's so thin and cute his hair thin his mouth mute<br/>yet I love him his black ink eyes<br/>his blueish flickering like a drop of rain<br/>we were pouring together from our eyes like wells<br/>we pull the chain and swallow rain<br/>we swing between the notes we sing<br/>we seem to flow between the fields we grow<br/>the moon rides low upon its fiery glow<br/>all children move their sharp nails<br/>and stab the trees and wound the lakes<br/>they seem to be, whatever it takes<br/>they see the wind he violently shakes<br/>the silent voice of nothing<br/>it suddenly reappears<br/>the lighthouse on a mountain in an ocean of tears<br/>its candle glows bright burns far<br/>revealing another world while we sleep<br/>rips the air torn the sky reveals a creep<br/>they're sharpening their thorns<br/>and a crown of rays looking in its feys<br/>is a crowd of clocks looking for their days.<br/>
