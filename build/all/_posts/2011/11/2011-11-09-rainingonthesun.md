Many words and damp<br/>all is raining on the sun<br/>and the mist is high<br/>filling all the space behind<br/><br/>in a grey sunrise<br/>all the letters vapourize<br/>every speechless man<br/>keeps on trying to speak in vain<br/><br/>all the words were slain<br/>then poured on the sun to rain<br/>since the silence needs<br/>to be free to live again<br/><br/>they were thought to know<br/>when to shout and when to shut<br/>and the silence made<br/>all them know that so was not<br/><br/>they refused to live<br/>in a flat and silent world<br/>all the sounds they had<br/>were fit for the human voice<br/><br/>and at first no one<br/>wanted chose the other choice<br/>but at last they had:<br/>or a speaker or a sad.<br/><br/>When the rain begun<br/>they'd been happy for a while<br/>other sounds relied<br/>for the silence reconcile<br/><br/>and the sky was all<br/>filled with violins and guitars<br/>and the flute and drums<br/>improvised with iron bars.<br/><br/>Every drop they ate<br/>really gave nothing to say<br/>and the silence staid<br/>on and on to fly on they.
