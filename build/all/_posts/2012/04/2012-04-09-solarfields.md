On the solar fields<br/>the wind blows gently<br/>smooth as a silky skin<br/>soapy as a tiny hand,<br/>the hand of a lil girl,<br/>the skin of a place<br/>from which there's no return;<br/>on the solar fields<br/>there is a weird atmosphere<br/>no light, but a sea of fire<br/>all is odd and lonely<br/>like a black and white movie<br/>like one of those photos<br/>in which nobody speaks<br/>which nobody knows about;<br/>on the solar fields<br/>the great shame of solitude<br/>has been long ago forgiven<br/>we have been redeemed<br/>and a sea of gowns<br/>of beauty faces,<br/>- I can't exorcise these of me -<br/>of beauteous skins and lines<br/>- it's me who must be exorcised -<br/>of sorrowful answers<br/>to questions never lifted<br/>since there is no problem at all<br/>our imagination is revolving<br/>on the same still dot,<br/>around the neck<br/>and the same old knot.
