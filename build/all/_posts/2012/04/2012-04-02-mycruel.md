My cruel yours,<br/>I am possessed<br/>my tentacle of consciousness<br/>touches faces with no name,<br/>it seems I can no more<br/>make senses nor give voices<br/>cry out my dreams and choices;<br/>nobody listening,<br/>black night, dark knight<br/>all this images are fine<br/>to be cut and put into place<br/>to be glued stuck in a rhyme<br/>still they give me drops of glee,<br/>of a bright-eyed vanity,<br/>still there is a voice in me,<br/>like an island in the sea,<br/>I send bottles to nowhere<br/>to nobody who's in there<br/>yet there is nothing to mend<br/>water air some trees and sand.
