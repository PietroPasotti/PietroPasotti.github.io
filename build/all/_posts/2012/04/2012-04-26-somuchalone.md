When you walk on river<br/>we used to be friends on<br/>I can almost taste what we left<br/>on the shores of the past<br/>only clouds will be spared<br/>that's what we give for<br/>despair;<br/><br/>when you seem to be punished<br/>you laugh on your scars<br/>when you're thought to be happy<br/>you never really are,<br/>I can almost taste what we left<br/>tiny silly simulacrum of lust<br/>little piece of our love<br/>sudden thought of a man,<br/>in search of a place for the jump.<br/><br/>When you walk on the words<br/>we used to love on with<br/>every mouthful of air is still there<br/>every single footprint<br/>is still there on the grass<br/>making us seem so much alone.
