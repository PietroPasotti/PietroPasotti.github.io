Here you had to<br/>listen to my song<br/>my love, my wrong<br/>I know you're beautiful<br/>but strong<br/>and sorrowful<br/>like a bubble on a sting<br/>a moth without a wing;<br/>there, listen to my song<br/>my love, my wrong<br/>if all I do was done for you<br/>if all I am was made of me<br/>so why with you, why can't I be?<br/>Melt together in a flake of snow<br/>my gift for you, my cake of sorrow<br/>down your throat<br/>in your eyes<br/>I will dive while you're asleep<br/>let me climb onto their deep<br/>let me see what they're made of<br/>why they look so full of love.<br/>In the blink of an eye<br/>I'll make me invisible<br/>I'll make me incredible<br/>threatening your throat<br/>with my song without a note<br/>will you love, me, tomorrow?<br/>will you try my cake of sorrow?<br/><br/><i>To Benedetta...</i>
