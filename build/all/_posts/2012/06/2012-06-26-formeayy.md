The clouds are black<br/>the ship has wrecked<br/><br/>the flower tower bends on ground<br/>what has she found?<br/><br/>The secrets told are so no more<br/>they were before,<br/>they were before.<br/><br/>Ayy, the voice told me<br/>once there, I would be, free<br/><br/>ayy, they played cruelly<br/>on my skin, on my hands, on me.<br/><br/>The bubbles broken fly no more<br/>they flew before,<br/>they flew before.<br/><br/>Ayy, this moment is, for me<br/><br/>ayy, this place is, safe from harm<br/>this spot of grass, is still being warm<br/><br/>ayy, betrayed the nature, of me<br/><br/>ayy, I made it all, for me...
