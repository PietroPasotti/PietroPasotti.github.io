The sands of time are held tightly<br/>by evil hands inside of me<br/>and all the stones under my feet<br/>begin to burn with silent hate<br/><br/>shadows longing for your eyes<br/>towards your breath with iron knives<br/>slip within the night<br/>their holy hearts exploding bright;<br/><br/>what for my hands keep trembling on<br/>when I on you set eye upon?<br/>My love should know what could it be<br/>but not the truth I hold in me<br/><br/>amazing nights my dear you know<br/>when we fly high and sky is low<br/>and morning air runs smiling through<br/>the tight embrace of me and you<br/><br/>is there a secret I can sense<br/>the morning air is still intense<br/>keeps hiding in her eyes a glee<br/>which I can feel but still can't see<br/><br/>her evil grin and digging claws<br/>under the silk in our skin grows<br/>but then appears sun's golden line<br/>and tells me what was over: time.
