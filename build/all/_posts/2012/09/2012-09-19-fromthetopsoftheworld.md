From the tops of the world<br/>I think of the sky<br/>and deeply behind<br/>where death only lie<br/>swallows in darkness<br/>the things as they die.<br/><br/>The deepest of me<br/>is far from the blue<br/>is hard to be only<br/>with never being true<br/>a nonsense unwinds:<br/>my meaning is you.<br/><br/>From the tops of the world<br/>I ache for this change<br/>I beg for the lightning<br/>to come and revenge<br/>as dreams and their nights<br/>go far and derange.
