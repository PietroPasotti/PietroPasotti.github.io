Good morning<br/>did you just wake up?<br/>howling with wolves<br/>whimpering with owls<br/>on the marble stairs<br/>leading to the sun,<br/>was it fun?<br/><br/>did you dream about me?<br/>making seamless moves<br/>trying to get over it<br/>what a funny game we play<br/>are you like this every day?<br/><br/>did you say anything?<br/>I seem to crave your voice<br/>I seem to be honest<br/>but I am not brave<br/>and what about you,<br/>are you really true?<br/><br/>would you ask me anything?<br/>in the dark you sing<br/>in the sun you rest<br/>I see you daydreaming,<br/>should you try to make<br/>a better imitation of silence<br/>should you try<br/>if not, then, why?<br/>why?<br/><br/>Did you just wake up?<br/>was it fun to sleep alone?<br/>was it fun to know me alone?<br/>was it just a stupid joke<br/>to cheer at me and make me choke<br/>to smile on me<br/>without sharing my destiny?<br/>did you just turn on?<br/>what's it like to be in love?
