I'm a tiger in the wind<br/>in the flesh my claws will cleave<br/>in the blood my tongue will thrive<br/>snaking like a riverbed<br/>I didn't mean to make anything wrong<br/>using the wrong strenght<br/>on the impact we realize<br/>in the flesh the red surprise,<br/>rewind.<br/><br/>Back in time I wake up young<br/>I wake up strong, I wake up wrong<br/>it's a bad day raining hard<br/>pouring everything I love<br/>on the surface of the hills<br/>the landscape is wide,<br/>but with things filled,<br/>all the things I love the most<br/>blown around like scattered mist<br/>singing wirlwinds silent spring<br/>this is what's the wind I bring<br/>this is what my tiger roars<br/>while the rain devouring pours<br/>while the dreams unwind cruelly<br/>this is all I think of me,<br/>rewind.<br/><br/>Back in time I didn't wake<br/>once upon a nowhere<br/>the air sung a song I didn't know<br/>upon the notes of a silent snow<br/>the frost was clear like a child's eye<br/>watching its mum for the very first time,<br/>back in time that day was still<br/>yet beautifully nostalgic like a broken mill;<br/>the river bends<br/>the river flows<br/>the river mends<br/>the river knows<br/>the time is over, not even started,<br/>the youthful water has departed.<br/><br/>
