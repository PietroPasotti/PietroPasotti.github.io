My autumn clothes<br/>are fallen leaves<br/>my castle's filled<br/>of traps for thieves,<br/><br/>my shadow's very<br/>far from here<br/>so I, so I<br/>can't walk on her.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>Is in the flesh<br/>these arrows sting<br/>in the thin skin<br/>of the offspring.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>Gleam and gloom<br/>and shine and bloom,<br/>but look at the sun<br/>it's high, and it's one,<br/><br/>the world, fuck off, is cold!<br/>It is quite hard to be<br/>something like three seconds old.<br/><br/>fuck the world why are you so cold?<br/>sometimes, I wish,<br/>I were born old.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>Within these hands<br/>is growing fast<br/>an autumn seed<br/>is springing strong<br/><br/>but dreams of mine<br/>who you belong<br/>why, do you,<br/>still smell the frost.<br/><br/>Eyes wide open<br/>meeting yours<br/>while the Nature<br/>chooses its course.<br/><br/><i>Truthfully written some time ago... The time has come to put it back here, where she does belong. Though, its time has long passed, and you have changed, and so do I. See you, my lady. To F.</i>
