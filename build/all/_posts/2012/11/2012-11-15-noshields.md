No shields<br/>three flights around the world<br/>an angry demigod is thrusting in the sky<br/>bending clouds and metal<br/>in the very flesh of our truths<br/>in the bloody heart through every vein<br/>is climbing up our spine like pain<br/>double-sworded deeply madly<br/>eyes red with the deepest shade<br/>you won't even see its blade<br/>you will simply say goodbye;<br/>at the end of the road he can already see you<br/>in the square full of light where the clouds concentrate<br/>quick as a lightning is speeding your fate<br/>without any shield.
