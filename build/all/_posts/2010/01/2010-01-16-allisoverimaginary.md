All is over<br/>is over again<br/>all over again<br/>and I of nowhere<br/>noise of the someday<br/>somersaults there at the lake<br/>all is over<br/>circles in the water<br/>reflecting non existing clouds<br/>in an imaginary day;<br/>this light is a dream<br/>and you are over<br/>all is over again<br/>I'm singing for the silence<br/>or an imaginary girl,<br/>and all is all over again.
