Still falling<br/>mirror corridors repeat themselves<br/>magic tube I'm lost I'm lost,<br/>still falling<br/>I'm so tired of going down the same path<br/>so tired of hurting me like I used to do<br/>so tired of hitting the same edges;<br/>still falling<br/>I should have learned<br/>but pain can't teach<br/>what love can't learn.
