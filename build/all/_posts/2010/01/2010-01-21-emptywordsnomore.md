I like the other side<br/>to slip, to slip away,<br/>I want this hatred shade<br/>to fade, to fade away,<br/><br/>it's happening and I<br/>am watching overcome<br/>astonished wonders I<br/>am whispering - Enome.<br/><br/>I love the shadow there<br/>for what it hides today<br/>instead of brand new sore<br/>or empty words to say.
