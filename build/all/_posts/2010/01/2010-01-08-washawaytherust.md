Shut by time those clocks<br/>reminding me the rain,<br/>rust is covering my eyes<br/>I'm sick of watching the same clouds<br/>I'm sick of staring at still skies<br/>I'm sick of breathing that pale air<br/><br/>that raw fear I'm trying to tame<br/>I'll need your hand to toil my thoughts<br/>help me come clean<br/>my memories will scatter<br/>all I carelessly collected<br/>and destroyed not to return<br/>in my disembodied traits,<br/>on old papers used to burn.
