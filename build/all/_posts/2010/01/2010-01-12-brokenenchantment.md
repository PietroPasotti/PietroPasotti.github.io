Broken enchantments<br/>I walk on<br/>more and more tired<br/>more and more wounded;<br/><br/>I feel my eyes want to close<br/>I hear the noise of distant voices<br/>I speak of bad forgotten songs<br/><br/>leave them where they are<br/>don't hurt me with your bleeding sword<br/>deaf and dull I'm not worth living.
