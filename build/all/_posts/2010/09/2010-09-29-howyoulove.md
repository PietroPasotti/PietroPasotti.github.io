If how you love is who you are<br/>be your words, believe into<br/>your fingerprints on her face<br/>on her neck and down her throat<br/>you make hers your loving breath<br/>you shoot love like a  star.<br/><br/><br/>If how you love is who you are<br/>and smile your joy, no fear<br/>you taste her skin like an ice cream<br/>you'd still hold her to winter, fall,<br/>in the same barrel waterfall<br/>you shoot joy like a star.<br/>
