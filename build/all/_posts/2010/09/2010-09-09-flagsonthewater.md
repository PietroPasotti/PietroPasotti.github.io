As swirls like flames surround<br/>our bodies flags on the water<br/>they lie like flags on the water;<br/>canvas shines so brilliant<br/>so wet yet crimson tissues<br/>they follow oceans everywhere<br/>my heart seems broken;<br/>she scatters all around her arms<br/>all around her face<br/>her hair and they<br/>are flimsy flags on the water.<br/>
