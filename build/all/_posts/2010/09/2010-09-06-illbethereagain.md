As she said this ocean more<br/>the world revolved around her shore<br/>every word would say hello<br/>hello and thousands flies<br/>would rise and fly behind;<br/>you'd forget this moment<br/>this after will be lost<br/>your hands will lie forgotten<br/>your head towards the clouds.<br/>I'd say your empty head<br/>I'd cry on your face dead<br/>you've only flown away<br/>to look for your forever<br/>your eyes are lost together,<br/>your heart is bound to the ground<br/>I believe in stolen fires<br/>but only when are found.<br/><br/><br/>I'd thrust this spear<br/>and catch you back<br/>with the wood in my heart<br/>and iron nailing me<br/>down to the ground<br/>down to the earth;<br/>then you'll be back<br/>your eyes will open again<br/>you'll be here and free<br/>you'll look at me<br/>forgiving every rain<br/>and I'll be there again.<br/><br/><br/>
