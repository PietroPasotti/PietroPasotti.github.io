Lame lights are walking slowly<br/>and the path is in my hands<br/>rewinding different stories<br/>heard from time to time,<br/><br/><br/>the giant tree has golden teeth<br/>a shiny blossom aureole<br/>his eyes are quick and neat<br/>unlike another burial,<br/><br/><br/>crawling on<br/>hills of sand,<br/>rewind to mend<br/>things gone<br/><br/><br/>imploding light<br/>refuse to dim<br/>to be my sin<br/>is twinkling bright;<br/><br/><br/>fill oceans red<br/>the haunted eyes<br/>froze down to peace<br/>put him to bed.<br/><br/><br/>The old men surrounded him<br/>sickles flashed with sorrow screams<br/>the air was falling thin<br/>they all sank in their dreams;<br/><br/><br/>the tree had won but won had not<br/>he ate the death that all around<br/>drenched his roots with frozen blood<br/>and melt their faces without a sound;<br/><br/><br/>all comes to earth<br/>the flowers,<br/>the dirt.<br/><br/><br/>
