How much did he spend<br/>in trying to enjoy<br/>a lifeless leaf and a shapeless wind;<br/>here you are, follow me,<br/>toil your eyes and clean them up;<br/>they are water just like you<br/>perfect nothing in my cup.<br/><br/>Your vanilla heart<br/>is kissing down my memories<br/>turning suns to dust<br/>and to coldest iron, rust.<br/><br/>Help me, help me,<br/>am I yours, am I free?
