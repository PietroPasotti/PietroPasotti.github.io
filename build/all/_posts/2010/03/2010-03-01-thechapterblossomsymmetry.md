We were lonely, and denied,<br/>dying stars could be despised<br/>where dark and deaf lights cannot hide<br/>your floods, your seas, your tide.<br/><br/>We were stars at least, we were,<br/>bleeding happiness nowhere<br/>and lightning pleasures here and there<br/>empty roses black as air...<br/><br/>Forgotten, we were twilight frames<br/>shattered in crimsongs and despair<br/>blowing on our flames<br/>all we had, love, our dreams, thin air,<br/><br/>we were not who we are, and you<br/>mean freedom to my blinded heart<br/>you are the beads in which I sew<br/>my life still looking for its start.<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">To Martina...</span>
