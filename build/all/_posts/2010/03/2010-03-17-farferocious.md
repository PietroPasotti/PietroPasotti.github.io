Ferocious red<br/>your eyes make me<br/>on rooftops leaping suns<br/>make me stop the rain;<br/>anything but you<br/>should overcome the pain;<br/><br/>assure your time you're here<br/>you're here and smile again<br/>back to be frozen<br/>your fingers settle down<br/>have you lost your wings<br/>like the sun had missed this town?<br/><br/>Subtle mists keep pursuing me<br/>I cast my wind<br/>evoque my hardest heart<br/>have you ever seen<br/>when rain's about to start<br/><br/>how rivers forget your hands<br/>refusing to be touched<br/>afraid of being embraced<br/>leaving no footprints<br/>so as not to be traced?
