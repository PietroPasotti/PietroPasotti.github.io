I start again with flowers<br/>like I used long ago<br/>when I still wandered lonely<br/>with nothing else to know;<br/>sometimes rain just fall<br/>but when it starts to pour<br/>in your heart you start to sink<br/>while hopeless, you think.<br/>I pick up a Daisy<br/>it's like this I feel<br/>it's you my breath insid<br/>and you, like hope, can't fade.
