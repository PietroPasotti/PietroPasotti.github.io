Find peace in time<br/>when space is touched<br/>and you alone, dead star,<br/>in your wonder endless future<br/>your heart is getting slow<br/>your eyes are heatless fires<br/>oh, how sad I am<br/>so bright they used to be;<br/><br/>all inside the black has broken<br/>what our memory keeps alive<br/>tentacles of emptiness<br/>follow our nightmares<br/>but it's long since you last slept<br/>how much have you cried<br/>how much have you wept.
