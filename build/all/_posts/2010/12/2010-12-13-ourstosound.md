Switch on switch off<br/>tonight is safe <br/>tonight is ours<br/><br/><br/>all in a clean word I wouldn't say it all<br/>harmless arms tie soft and white<br/>since the very first time our dreams have all been true<br/>and my nights would be tears without you without you.<br/><br/><br/>Songs were written<br/>earth was broken<br/>we rose there<br/><br/><br/>and hopeless as she goes we make our pictures<br/>smell the happiness all around is ours is ours to sound. <br/>
