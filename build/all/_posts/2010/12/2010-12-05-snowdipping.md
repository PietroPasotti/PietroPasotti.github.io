Hands crossed<br/>dip myself in the earth<br/>snow I breathe<br/>and I couldn't care less<br/>I'm filled with emptiness<br/>I'm guest and no one's host<br/>this finally I lost<br/>cheerful eyes watch me no more<br/>thin soft hands don't look for me.<br/><br/><br/>You saw the shade<br/>with none to see but darkness<br/>with none to see but me<br/>you had, a constellation to confess.<br/>
