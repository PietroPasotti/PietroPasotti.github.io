I will rest<br/>on a tree<br/>on my own<br/>that is me<br/>that is you<br/>there's my life<br/>on a humble oak<br/>my truth<br/>is down my throat<br/>is down my chest,<br/><br/><br/>you come and think you're sleeping<br/>but fields are not all fields<br/>and  lying at my feet<br/>you're smaller far than me...<br/><br/><br/>You, big man,<br/>you, huge life,<br/>you, rich boy,<br/>self-handed wicked sword,<br/>you daemon in your eyes<br/>your blue is more blue<br/>your black is darker<br/>your heart is wrinkled<br/>your hands are whithering<br/>you can't caress<br/>my love<br/>you can't see<br/>the shines my eyes embrace<br/>you'll never walk<br/>my paths pouring with light,<br/>the truths we all can mend<br/>the feelings we understand.<br/>
