On the left and on the right, are you ready to burn bright;<br/>since halloweens have come<br/>the pumpkins are alive<br/><br/><br/>don't be afraid<br/><br/><br/>don't simply run away<br/>she'll take your eyes out of you<br/>she'll breath your life off of you;<br/><br/><br/>curtains are pulled closer<br/>windows are kept closed<br/>fearful smiles shine from behind<br/>thousands<br/>happy faces you won't touch<br/>thousands<br/>soft lips hide their teeth<br/><br/><br/>a tiny colour I can't leech.<br/><br/><br/>This is a torture<br/>a world of murder<br/>and how I suffer<br/>as I get closer<br/>I can almost see the faces<br/>still hidden in the glasses<br/>and I come closer<br/>one step more<br/>and lips adore.<br/>
