I wrote my name on a silver plate<br/>I wore myself like a red dress<br/>and carved my hands one another<br/>with them I'm now there;<br/><br/><br/>my green canvas on the street<br/>one square meter on the ground<br/>feet firmly on the earth<br/>and this is the way it goes;<br/><br/><br/>every path wouldn't cross mine<br/>every road bent not to meet<br/>what was too hard to admit<br/>and lead herself to another street.<br/><br/><br/>
