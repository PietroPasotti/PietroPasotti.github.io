I'm moth<br/>and soothing this<br/>who's murdering the sun<br/>on which I'm settling down?<br/><br/>Oh I'm tasting you<br/>and flickering your skin<br/>sun is bright<br/>the night is thin;<br/><br/>I'm moth<br/>my wings will shadow everything<br/>like shades are in the night<br/>which I'm about to sing;<br/><br/>the light won't dim<br/>and I can eat this happiness<br/>in this hysteria I drown<br/>in this everything like bliss.
