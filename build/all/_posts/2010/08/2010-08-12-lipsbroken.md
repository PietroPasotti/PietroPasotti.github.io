When the lips are broken<br/>and kisses full of lies<br/>fill empty and hateful arms<br/>cheeks meet my chance in silence<br/>nothing happens, they're the only left alive.<br/><br/>Messy shadows follow everywhere<br/>and fill your footprints with my love<br/>they'll glow all night<br/>and creamy moon<br/>defeats our lonely<br/>with rings of gloom.
