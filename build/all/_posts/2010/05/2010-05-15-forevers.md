As my feather has fallen<br/>my memory will break<br/>then falling into pieces<br/>what else can I make?<br/><br/>I've seen many deserts<br/>these lakes aren't glaciers<br/>these days are becoming<br/>so many forevers;<br/><br/>I'll bend as a flower<br/>still there to be seen<br/>another forever<br/>your fingers are green;<br/><br/>the brown of this table<br/>keeps pelting my eyes<br/>please make all this rain<br/>break down into ice.<br/><br/>The music keeps dancing<br/>the rhythm of our heart<br/>if skies will fall down<br/>maybe we'll depart;<br/><br/>this is not falling down<br/>it's higher and higher<br/>and higher forever<br/>then deep as we are.
