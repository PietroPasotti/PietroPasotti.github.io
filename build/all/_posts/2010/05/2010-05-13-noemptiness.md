Huge emptiness<br/>won't cope with our lives<br/>we are<br/>and we don't want to end.<br/><br/>This heart has no darkness,<br/>no fear no pain<br/>no weakness.<br/><br/>All lives which seem to fade<br/>just turn to something else<br/>to earth, to leaves,<br/>and petals.<br/><br/>We're tears fallen<br/>off flowers and a rainbow<br/>this happiness is our revenge<br/>to what wants us to bow.
