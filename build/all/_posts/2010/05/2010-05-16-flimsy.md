Flimsy mist is covering everything<br/>is darker than every grey<br/>will tear out of me<br/>every word I'd love to say;<br/><br/>I stick my head out of a broken window<br/>and I'm afraid we feel afraid<br/>enchanting of this crystal dusk<br/>every black of a darker shade;<br/><br/>I tremble then I say<br/>please, don't fly away.<br/><br/>Flimsy layers of a dancing steam<br/>fall with us all along the stream,<br/><br/>and she loved it, and so did I,<br/>stumbling moments in a clumsy action<br/>forgive the clouds we can't<br/>we're drenched in our own passion,<br/><br/>help us forgive ourselves, still smile,<br/>don't worry, every rock will fall<br/>release the pressure on the empty<br/>which shouldn't feel so small.
