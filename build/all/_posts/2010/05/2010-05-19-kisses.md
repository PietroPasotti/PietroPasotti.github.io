I'd give so many kisses<br/>to this is vanishing<br/>to this appearing air<br/>to this as seems nothing;<br/><br/>I'd give a kiss to you<br/>and the cathedral down<br/>whispering all names<br/>still without a sound;<br/><br/>friend is this silence<br/>and this happiness inside<br/>stand still I'm the bliss<br/>stand still for a kiss.
