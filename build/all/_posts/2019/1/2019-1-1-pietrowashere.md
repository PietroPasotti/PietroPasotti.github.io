<br/>Pietro was here,<br/>he came on foot,<br/>one late afternoon,<br/>maybe distracted<br/>by the moon,<br/>walking in town<br/>he turned many heads<br/>mostly chicken and cats<br/>but whatever. <br/><br/>Pietro was here<br/>and suddenly <br/>all villagers wanted <br/>to do something about it;<br/>they brought mandarins<br/>and he ate two<br/>the third he gave to a cute little boy<br/>who gave it to a bigger brat<br/>but whatever.<br/><br/>They brought a kilo of nuts<br/>and Pietro started cracking them<br/>two by two,<br/>but they took the nuts away<br/>and went crackin' in the kitchen<br/>but whatever.<br/><br/>The gite went all alive<br/>after a very long while<br/>everyone had forgotten how to do it<br/>but they were doing their best<br/>and they were pretty good at it<br/>they can't tell a yes from a no<br/>or east from west<br/>but hell,<br/>they really know how to spell<br/>'good review on Booking.com'<br/>but whatever.
