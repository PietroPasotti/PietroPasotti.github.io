And still the smoke keeps flowing<br/>through the gates painted blue<br/>shining in the sunset<br/>chiseling the shadows<br/>putting gently the great market<br/>to sleep.<br/><br/>No minute goes unnoticed<br/>by the golden solar clock<br/>the syk is clear, the sun goes hard<br/>on wooden curtains overhead<br/>yet the dust won't settle<br/>nor the noise can die<br/>as if trapped by million echoes<br/>under green roof tiles.<br/><br/>Pouring through these gates<br/>the breath of a living city<br/>a heart that throught the day<br/>through the night will not stop beating.
