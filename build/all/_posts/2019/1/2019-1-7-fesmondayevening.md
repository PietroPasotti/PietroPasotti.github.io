<br/>A young man and his mother<br/>go to Fes on Monday noon<br/>but leave a little bit too soon<br/>a minute later they'd have seen<br/>a little goat climb on a mule<br/>while all the kids get out of school<br/>and the tall man from the blue house<br/>throw his apples to the cows<br/>while a bow who couldn't see<br/>slipped and stumbled in their pee,<br/>and things kept happening that way<br/>for the rest of that market day.
