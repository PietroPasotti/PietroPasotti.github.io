Someone gave the stone<br/>a thick white wash,<br/>to hide the blood away<br/>the stone remained<br/>and we still pay<br/>with our fresh blood<br/>for lies we didn't tell.<br/><br/>Empty dwellings along the way<br/>frozen fireplaces lie still<br/>the trees cast shadow on dry sand<br/>nothing more grows on the land<br/>but still behind that hill<br/>a white stone stands still today.
