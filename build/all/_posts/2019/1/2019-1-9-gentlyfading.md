The pounding rhythm <br/>that had animated my steps<br/>leading then from stone to star<br/>is gently fading,<br/>I can feel,<br/>gently fading.<br/><br/>When my lips are sealed<br/>I no longer sing<br/>when the light goes out<br/>I no longer seek the stars<br/>I am thus getting old,<br/>tired of seeking so far.<br/><br/>The fiery energy<br/>that had shone in my eyes<br/>also blinding in its light<br/>is gently fading,<br/>I can feel, gently fading.
