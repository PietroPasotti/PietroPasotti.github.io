Good that you took care of me<br/>in my moments of weakness<br/>sometimes too crushed<br/>to even hold our breath in our skins<br/>still we had the love<br/>to keep our bones together<br/>like ducklings through the weather<br/>penguins in the storm<br/>that's where we were born.<br/><br/>Can we be close to Earth?<br/>Tempting empty spaces<br/>tend to us their wounded eyes<br/>asking to be filled<br/>with more than gaseous ice.
