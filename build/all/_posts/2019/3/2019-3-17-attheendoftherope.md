Strange<br/>to feel these new boundaries<br/>measure these new distances<br/>it's still me at the end of the rope<br/>the same dream, weakness, hope,<br/><br/>if I hold you up<br/>will you hoist yourself<br/>until you can't see the ground?<br/><br/>I can't pull anymore<br/>to see what's on your side<br/>it's enough to hit the ground<br/>to see my castle bend<br/>I have enough cracks<br/>to which I need to tend<br/>so climbing up that rope<br/>is a choice we take alone.
