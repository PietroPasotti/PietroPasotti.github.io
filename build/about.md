This blog is my poetry archive. It dates back to 2008 and contains more stuff than you can read. Most of it I don't like, some of it I do. Most of it only says something of the person I was the moment I wrote it, and not of the person I was a moment earlier or later.

It started as a way of writing myself so I could read myself and find out things I didn't know I knew. It became a way of writing myself so I could avoid hurting myself. It ended a way of writing myself so I didn't have to read myself.
And sometimes also for the lols.

This blog has had different names at different times.

One day this progression will make an interesting story, one that I am looking forward to write. <br/> Or read.
